Although these data were collected before recreational marijuana use was legalized in Illinois, it is possible that attitudes toward marijuana use are generally more permissive in Chicago relative to other parts of the country. Future research should examine regional variations in responses to substance use in perinatal care settings. In addition, this analysis is premised on the uptake of legal tasks by individual providers in settings where testing is based on provider discretion. Studies examining how law shapes provider-patient interactions in systems where universal drug testing is carried out may reveal different patterns and outcomes. Another  limitation of this study is that the data reflect providers' interpretations and perceptions of hospital testing protocol. In the future, researchers should examine official, documented hospital protocol to understand how formal organizational policy shapes provider practices. Finally, given sample size limitations and the wide range of state and organizational responses to substance use during pregnancy, these findings are not intended to capture practices in perinatal care by and large. Rather, these findings reflect dilemmas workers may contend with in settings where they are given latitude over the degree to which they adopt legal tasks or not.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 0}

Access to more comprehensive data, particularly from startups that are typically reticent to share details, would provide a deeper understanding of sectoral variation and technology maturity (for example, technology readiness levels) for different types of investors and their impact. Such data can potentially create avenues to improve models that inform climate policy. It could also be used to explore different types of public investors besides grant agencies that aim to generate financial returns  (for example, green banks or public agencies that invest equity in startups) or private investors (for example, financially motivated climate-impact investors) to provide a more complete picture of the public and private funding landscape. With more data over time, future work could potentially establish causal relationships between variables and assess the potential impact of systematic factors such as startup maturity on investment outcomes. Mixed-method analyses that combine data on individual grant programmes such as ARPA-E with insights on specific types of investor (for example, corporate investors with various core businesses, climate-impact investors, other private investors) could further inform public policies on how to most effectively support grant recipients through all phases of startup development.

Here we provide robust and statistically significant evidence showing that the adoption of carbon pricing in one country can explain the subsequent adoption of carbon pricing in other countries. For a neighbouring country, diffusion increases the probability of policy adoption on average by several percentage points. Translating these empirical estimates with Monte Carlo simulations into global reductions in emissions through policy diffusion suggests that for many countries, decreases in emissions as a result of diffusion could be larger than domestic emission reductions. These results support the adoption of stringent climate  policies, especially in countries in which climate change mitigation  might be considered as not very important because of relatively low levels  of domestic emissions.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 3}

In AFR and LAM, where many households are remotely located, have easy access to biomass resources and limited access to modern cooking services, we found biomass dependency is likely to persist. For these populations, the inconveniences and health impacts of cooking with polluting stoves need to be factored into the household choice decision. This requires committed and sustained policies to provide easy access to modern fuels and stoves at affordable prices, and information and behaviour change messaging.

Americans maintain enormous confidence in their personal physicians and in the medical treatment of disease. As medical authority continues to expand over a wider set of conditions and the pharmaceutical armamentarium continues to grow (Clarke et al. 2003), the apparent benefits of pharmaceuticals might loom so large as to overwhelm serious consideration of their numerous side effects. To be sure, the neglect of side effects might be especially prominent with respect to mental health given that patients and physicians might be willing to trade some measure of emotional well-being for an improvement in disease, physical functioning, or longevity. But the tendency to neglect side effects is more general, and other side effects are almost certainly overlooked as well. Adapting theories regarding the minority mental health advantage only requires a more complete accounting of risks and resources, arrayed over a somewhat more complex ledger. It also requires integrating sociology's understanding of the causes of mental health, informed by fundamental cause theory, with its understanding of how patients interface with medicine.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 5}

One intuitively appealing approach to this problem is to ramp up the costs of climate action over time. This lowers costs in the near to medium term but also requires individuals to keep adjusting to steadily increasing carbon prices. Our results indicate that such cost plans run the risk of reducing support for climate policies because many individuals prefer to smooth their consumption over time. The ramping-up approach could remain politically feasible if some voters focus on near-term costs or if policy experience causes mass preferences to become more favourable towards costly climate action in general. But to the extent that policymakers seek to design policies that are transparent and meet meaningful emission reduction goals, constant cost plans promise more support for climate action relative to ramping-up approaches. Moreover, owing to the delay in large-scale policy responses to climate change, countries will probably have to pursue more progressive and costly climate action to limit the adverse effects of global warming. The drop in support because of higher costs associated with these more ambitious policy efforts may be at least partially mitigated by selecting a set of attractive design features such as the constant distribution of costs.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 6}

This increase is more accentuated for regions with high removal since more negative emissions are deployed in the 2030s and 2040s24 and these are financed with a higher carbon price (Fig. 2). However, negative emissions are lower in the second half of the century if the budget is not overshot. Consequently, the inequality implications of negative emissions are reduced, especially for highly impacted countries (fourth bracket).Thus, promoting net-negative emissions by overshooting emissions and temperature leads to an intertemporal inequality trade-off between regressive mitigation in the short term and regressive NET ownership in the long term. For the countries that are more impacted by the inequality repercussions of negative emissions, Fig. 4 indicates that a smaller overshoot is preferable. Furthermore, while not estimated in this study, climate damages avoided with lower temperature overshoot would be likely to have progressive effects and support the rationale for reducing overshoot.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 8}

Throughout fall 2020, when the possibility of a vaccine was becoming a reality, public health and medical practice journals published numerous editorials with recommendations for how to effectively and equitably roll out  the vaccine (Persad, Peek, and Emanuel 2020). However, states must work within the existing public health and health care infrastructure to provide the vaccine in a manner that fulfills more stringent requirements than most vaccines. Given the existing unequal infrastructure, it would be difficult to imagine that the vaccine distribution could be done equitably. The first weeks of vaccine distribution saw reporting from media outlets questioning the equity of allocation locations (Harper 2021; Oladipo 2021).

When removing the emission reductions claimed through RECs, companies' combined 2015-2019 scope 2 emission trajectories are no longer aligned with the 1.5 \u00b0C goal, and only barely with the well below 2 \u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. If this trend continues, 42% of committed scope 2 emission reductions will not result in real-world mitigation.

Instead, we find that these policies diffuse internationally. We consider this as evidence consistent with the idea that leadership in climate policy can send a credible signal about the willingness to cooperate to other countries, supporting the formation of global climate coalitions that have been proposed27,28. Similarly, ex-ante modelling studies have repeatedly predicted carbon leakage29 as a consequence of leadership. Empirical studies, however, find that leakage is a very minor or no concern30-32.

However, problems arise if these historical metrics are not representative of the future, following a change in the probability distribution of losses38. For example, we estimate that if there were an increase in the average global level of carbon tax enforced on Scope 1 and 2 emissions to US$100 (or climate policies with an equivalent shadow carbon price), the ratio of interest expenses over EBITDA for oil and gas firms might increase substantially above the ratio of renewable energy companies (from 16% to 46% against 32% for renewable energy). Similarly, a partial write-off of oil reserves valuations in the balance sheet of oil and gas companies of US$20 per barrel might result in an increase in the debt to asset ratio of these firms, much higher than the average value observed among renewable energy companies (from 16% to 86% against 32% for renewable energy).

In addition to the problem that market-based accounting allows reporting emission reductions that are not real, there is a risk of double counting the emission benefits of renewable energy generation if one company claims the use of specific renewable energy generation using market-based accounting, whereas other companies count that same renewable energy using the grid average emission factor in their location-based accounting. There are at least two alternatives that would make it more likely that all reported scope 2 emission reductions are real and renewable energy generation is only counted once (see Table 1). First, SBTi could require all companies to use only location-based accounting. A potential drawback with this option is that it would disincentivize companies from using PPAs or other market-based instruments that can lead to additional renewable energy generation. In the second alternative, all stakeholders might also reject the use of market-based instruments altogether, whether additional or not, as this way of claiming to be supplied by renewable energy does not reflect how renewable energy supply relies on a broader system of grid-balancing, back-up capacity and transmission services, which are often supported by tax payers or other energy consumers10.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 24}

Gender performance theories and gendered power and resource allocation perspectives generate the study's two hypotheses about the relationship between structural sexism and preventive care. In high-sexism environments, gender performance theory suggests that men would be less likely and women more likely to access needed preventive care, and gendered power and resource allocation perspective posits that both men and women would be less likely to access care. Findings suggest that both theoretical perspectives contribute to our understanding of health care use among men, whereas only a gendered power and resource allocation perspective is relevant for women. Results demonstrate a pattern of universal harm, suggesting that reducing structural sexism is a promising approach to increasing preventive care use for both women and men in the United States. This study provides novel empirical evidence and important theoretical insights with policy implications for preventive health care use.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 26}

Progressive taxes would alleviate the inequality increase after net zero, but with limited effect until NET revenues are paid for with carbon tax revenues. Separated targets for emission reduction and removal might lead to under- or overprovision of negative emissions. Similarly,  profit or price caps would distort the market, incentivize strategic behaviour from the companies, might undermine long-term incentives for cost reduction and would reduce the attractivity of investments in NETs. Nonetheless, especially around and after net-zero emissions, the severity of the distributional dynamics we highlighted suggests that the drawbacks of a fully integrated carbon market justify preventive intervention. At the same time, alternative policy provisions should provide adequate attractiveness and profitability for investments in NETs (see Supplementary Annex F for a quantification of this trade-off) and should strive to maintain overall policy efficiency. Therefore, the economic and political economy implications of the different policy options sketched here should be carefully explored.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 27}

This side effect of the rules might impair the transition towards net-zero carbon emissions and in turn contribute to increasing the build-up of transition risk in the financial system. Our comparison of financial ratios between oil and gas and renewable energy firms indicates that this effect might penalize investments in clean energy. Current financial accounting practices might unintentionally hinder the shift of funds required for the green transition, especially in Europe where these investments are often provided by the banking sector. While the desire to promote a green transition may be based on broader social objectives that lie beyond the remit of financial regulators, the deeper problem for regulators is that this transition could represent a potential source of systemic risk. Broader research is needed to determine whether the existing regulations sufficiently account for any such emerging sources of systemic risks that might accompany the green transition. More research is also needed to shed light on whether this bias might be present in other similar model-based frameworks (for example, capital requirements). Finally, regulators and investors should investigate risk models that include forward-looking assessments of climate and energy transition risk to ensure that those risks are appropriately incorporated in decisions and to remove any inadvertent bias.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 29}

The AIR Louisville cohort participants were enrolled through a number of channels and did not have standardized clinical oversight. We lacked access to individual-level data on participants (for example, healthcare utilization, socio-economic status, smoking or tobacco-smoke exposure), although most of these factors are considered time-invariant and controlled for by  the study design. Time-varying factors, however, both at the individual and area level could have confounded our results. A prior study found that the digital health intervention (that is, Propeller inhaler system) may have helped reduce SABA use, with the largest improvements during the first few months47. If enrolment in the programme coincided with plant changes, this could have resulted in overestimated effects. However, our within-person interrupted time-series design suggested an abrupt change in SABA use at the time of a SO2-control installation and a continued decline thereafter. We assumed a linear trend in outcome, although changes may have followed a non-linear pattern. Although the results in Fig. 6 suggest that the largest change in SABA use corresponds to the largest drop in HyADS in Q2-2015, we lacked the individual-level data in the pre-period to assess this statistically. At the ZIP-code level, due to data limitations, we could not consider asthma-related hospitalizations and ERVs separately, nor could we track multiple events within individuals. Finally, we were not able to assess cumulative impacts; for example, the relationship between chronic coal-fired power-plant-related exposures and asthma prevalence or the cooccurrence of asthma and chronic disease.

Well-intentioned environmental laws have been perversely used to block projects that climate policies seek to promote. That has been seen with lawsuits under the California Environmental Quality Act, which have been weaponized to advance economic agendas from the private sector and put forward NIMBY claims against housing and greening projects that will serve people of color and diversify communities45.

Inequities in care are extensively documented and span many clinical settings and health conditions, including cardiovascular care (Lewey and Choudhry 2014), diabetes treatment (Peek, Cargill, and Huang 2007), kidney transplantations (Daw 2015; Malek et al. 2011), mental health services (Neighbors et al. 2007), addiction treatment (Hansen, Parker, and Netherland 2020; Hansen and Skinner 2012), cancer screenings (Lansdorp-Vogelaar et al. 2012; Morris et al. 2010; Tehranifar et al. 2009), and HIV/AIDS treatment (Bogart et al. 2010). The experience of unequal care manifests across multiple settings both directly and indirectly related to the health care system. The United States has a long and appalling history of racism in policy creation and enforcement. Policies are often enacted to maintain existing power structures and prioritize the dominant power group (Krieger 2001, 2012). Because the dominant power group in the United States has been historically White, policies and policy enforcement disadvantage and exclude people of color, often resulting in deleterious health consequences. Examples include the War on Drugs, which affected how pain was recognized and treated for Black patients; banks' redlining policies; highway construction; mass incarceration; and other  segregationist measures that affect the neighborhoods and broader environments in which people of color live and work (e.g., Bailey et al. 2017; Roberts 1999; Rothstein 2017).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 36}

First, our results suggest an important co-benefit of deployment policies: the acceleration of technological change by allowing the finance industry to experiment and learn. RET investments are long-term, and the finance industry typically struggles to assess long-term risks of new technologies without a track record34,42. For instance, green state investment banks  can be an instrument to accelerate learning in the finance industry, helping investors assess projects and build confidence in new technologies43. Second, our results indicate that a large RET financing market and a high degree of competition between investors were crucial in creating more favourable financing conditions for RETs. Therefore, policies should try to crowd-in a broad spectrum of investors. Third, our findings point out that policymakers  should be vigilant in responding to changes in monetary policies that have an impact on RET costs. As RET generation costs approach grid parity, policymakers in some countries consider phasing out fixed remuneration schemes for RETs. While some have argued that achieving high RET shares requires de-risking policies in any case44, our results stress the particular importance of policy intervention (for example, RET support or carbon  pricing) given the likelihood of an imminent increase in interest rates. Ending policies might be premature and put climate change targets at risk. Policymakers also could evaluate new approaches, such as green monetary policies, to ensure attractive financing conditions for RETs and other low-carbon technologies in  the future45.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 37}

There is no doubt that repowering can increase the total contribution of wind energy from a given land area. However, we demonstrate that this contribution is not as high as theoretically possible based on physical considerations alone. Considering only the on-site replacement of turbines might lead to the misperception that a net repowering factor of 7.05 could have been achieved in Denmark, that is, that the installed capacity after completing an average repowering project would be 7.05 times higher than  the original capacity. In fact, by establishing causal relationships between repowering projects and all dismantled turbines, which include the additional off-site capacity removed, we observed that the actual net capacity repowering factor per project was only 4.72. Although the repowering potential within a project may still be considerable, it is weakened by the conditional dismantling of unwanted off-site turbines and the associated land use and societal considerations that this dismantling may serve. In addition, turbines dismantled in repowering projects achieved an average operating age of 5.8 years less than those dismantled on a stand-alone basis (non-repowering) and are often dismantled before reaching the end of their operational life. Accordingly, repowering may arrive earlier and with a stronger force than would be predicted when taking an end-of-life perspective.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 52}

In some cases, interventions such as seaweed afforestation were reported to be pursuing both climate mitigation and adaptation goals simultaneously. We observed frequent use of the term 'resilience' by many practitioners in self-reporting the ecological and social goals and benefits of their chosen intervention in lieu of providing more intervention-specific detail to which they were invited. Resilience has been widely critiqued for being conceptually vague, ignoring power and politics, and being operationally weak77,78. This lack of clarity on resilience obfuscates efforts to assess effectiveness of interventions and fails to deal with power asymmetries and inequity in pursing climate actions79. Rectifying this lack of climate goal precision (and therefore accountability) will depend on funders and public-interest actors demanding uptake of principles and codes of practice (see High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles80) and, increasingly, standards for monitoring, reporting and evaluation of specific intervention effects30,37,81,82.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 54}

For instance, do community solar features such as cancellation terms and transferability (whether customers can keep community solar subscriptions when changing addresses) affect adopter demographics? Similarly, future research could analyse how different community solar LMI policies affect adopter demographics. Our results suggest that various approaches can be effective\u2014such as customer-level incentives, project-level incentives, and LMI carve outs\u2014but future research could explore whether certain approaches are more cost-effective than others. Further, future research could explore how LMI community solar programmes could optimize the benefits that accrue to LMI customers, such as through guaranteed bill savings and customer protections.

These payments help stabilize generator revenues, making investment in capacity more attractive for risk-averse investors when other outlets for risk trading are limited. Here we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve large-scale stochastic equilibrium models describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading. Introduction of a capacity mechanism has an asymmetric effect on the risk profile of different generation technologies, tilting the resource mix towards those with lower fixed costs and higher operating costs. One implication of this result is that current market structures may be ill-suited to financing low-carbon resources, the most scalable of which have high fixed costs and near-zero operating costs.

Although evidence suggests that social distancing measures are critical for helping limit the spread of infection and strains on the health care system (Delen, Eryarsoy, and Davazdahemami 2020; Lewnard et al. 2020), it has also been suggested the social consequences of stay-at-home orders may have had psychological costs (Douglas et al. 2020; Tull et al. 2020). Our analyses provide support for these concerns, suggesting that the necessity of social distancing was concomitant with a rise in psychological distress. The mental health costs of social distancing are especially important to take into account because these measures also curtailed individuals' abilities to seek out medical or therapeutic assistance for increased distress. Advocates have suggested that a critical response to social distancing policies is the fortification of programs and mechanisms that will help to address a surge in mental health problems during the pandemic (Galea, Merchant, and Lurie 2020), and the results of the current research support these proposals.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 57}

We showed that a uniform carbon price across energy and LU sectors substantially lowers the specific emissions attributed to a unit of bioenergy in comparison with scenarios without broad LU regulations. Regulations of bioenergy demand reduce deployment level but fail to induce a reduction of the EF, keeping it virtually at a high level and thus resulting in substantially higher overall mitigation effort and carbon prices to reach climate targets. A bioenergy consumption tax fails to steer LUC decisions towards low-EF areas and cannot prevent the conversion of higher-carbon land; hence, it is not suitable to emulate the uniform carbon price regime across all sectors. Our analysis thus shows that global regulation of LUC emissions\u2014while being extremely aspirational\u2014is essential for bioenergy to be beneficial for cost-effective mitigation. The comprehensive coverage of all carbon-rich land areas worldwide is of the utmost importance, as even a 90% forest protection has only little effect on the EF. Since the conditions for such an exhaustive policy framework to materialize are highly idealized, involving close collaboration between and functioning governance within all countries, this finding implies climate policy sequencing: first, global LU regulation needs to be in place, and only then should large-scale bioenergy be considered. Pushing ambitious land-based mitigation is compelling  because GHG emissions from food production will need to be substantially reduced regardless to meet the 1.5\u00b0 or well below 2\u00b0 target48\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 58}

Two-thirds of studies analyzed in a meta-analysis found evidence of interpersonal racism in the medical setting (Paradies, Truong, and Priest 2014). This can manifest as implicit bias against Black and Latina patients (Blair et al. 2013; Hoffman et al. 2016), and indeed, Black women report more mistreatment and disrespect during childbirth than White women (Altman et al. 2019; Logan et al. 2022; McLemore et al. 2018; Slaughter-Acey et al. 2016; Vedam et al. 2019).

We examined multiple interventions across several years and tracked the intervention impacts at several phases (that is, intervention, emissions, exposure and health outcome). An important analytical decision in quasiexperimental studies is the choice of control group. Our differencein-differences analysis compared changes between ZIP codes that were initially most exposed to the power plants that generated the transition and control ZIP codes that were comparatively less subject to exposure from these plants. In our first-difference analysis, we used ZIP codes that experienced less reduction in HyADS exposure during the study period to control for time trends in hospitalizations and ERVs and other factors over the study period, and thereby minimized the threat of confounding due to such factors. Both designs control for the variation in observed and unobserved fixed characteristics of place46. At the individual level, we implemented a within-person analysis, which regards each person as his or her own control, to reduce the threat of bias associated with confounding variables related to differences across people.

Blue Hg stock is therefore an important, dynamic, reactive but overlooked Hg pool in the global Hg cycle and health risk. Blue C ecosystems can provide a range of ecosystem services such as protecting biodiversity and fisheries and increasing water quality. However, the co-accumulation and contrary ecological effects of OC and Hg in coastal ecosystems indicate that expanding Blue C ecosystems are very likely to add to the Blue Hg stock, consequently resulting in an increase of Hg risk in global coastal seas (Fig. 2). Delay and failure to implement the Blue C strategies may well accelerate the impending climate catastrophe and other coastal and ecological disasters, inevitably resulting in substantial economic, ecological and human losses3. We refer to increased Blue Hg stocks and the risk caused by expanding Blue C ecosystems to mitigate climate change and achieve co-benefits as the 'Blue Hg dilemma'. The close interactions between C and Hg in coastal ecosystems point to the importance of a holistic understanding of the benefits, risks and trade-offs of Blue C sequestration strategies. We highlight that the Blue Hg dilemma should be accounted for in future Blue C strategy assessments to inform policymakers and help them design better management and restoration policies across sectors and actors that can balance economic, ecological, climatic and health interests for future generations, particularly in the context of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 70}

Moreover, because little is known about how providers manage this bias within their patient interactions, recommendations for improving these encounters may inevitably fall short. Indeed, the patient-provider relationship is central to the provision of health care. Patients are, overall, more active consumers than in the past, and the provider-patient relationship has become less paternalistic as a result. However, because of how U.S. health care is structured and the rise of disease nationwide, the clinical encounter is pivotal to health outcomes because providers guide downstream access to care (Boyer and Lutfey 2010).

Welfare state spending effort divided between social investment and social protection spending modifies the classic inverse relationship between SES and depression. Distinguishing policy areas in both social investment and social protection spending demonstrates that policy programs devoted to education, early childhood education and care, active labor market policies, old age care, and incapacity account for differences in the effect of SES across countries.

However, this article's numerical experiments reveal the potential for substantial shifts, as both examples exhibit a significant increase in capacity of the peaking technology after the introduction of an options contract. The struggles of US nuclear units, which have been unable to find counterparties for long-term contracts without state support despite their potential role as a hedge against future increases in natural gas and carbon prices, suggests that the mechanism demonstrated in this article may be at work in current markets. This result is particularly important in the context of efforts to reduce carbon  emissions. The majority of energy in low-carbon systems is likely to be provided by some combination of hydroelectric, nuclear, wind and solar resources, all of which are characterized by high capital costs and low operating costs. Accordingly, capacity markets as currently structured may work against efforts to decarbonize. To achieve an efficient capacity mix requires the ability to share risk. Integrated resource planning, which can be made versatile enough to incorporate whatever sources of risk are viewed to be most salient, is one way to do so. A second, modelled in this article, is an energy-only market accompanied by the robust trade of instruments adapted to the risk profile of customers and various technologies. Neither of these strategies is without challenges. Capacity markets can offer a partial solution to the problem of risk sharing. The results of this study, however, reveal the consequences that choices made in the design of these markets may have for the resource mix that arises in liberalized electricity systems.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 80}

This might be an indication that political elites have been shown to do frequently44,45. However, even assuming that the commission members gave constituents in coalmining regions precedence over voters in other parts of the country would not explain why such a late date was chosen, as even in those regions respondents preferred phase-out dates between 2025 (western Germany) and 2030 (eastern Germany). An alternative explanation for this mismatch is that voter preferences simply did not play a decisive role in the consultations of the commission. As Fig. 5 illustrates, citizen voices (represented by non-governmental organizations, for example) were under-represented among the 28 commission members. Moreover, most commission members were insulated from re-election pressures, and some might have emphasized short-term economic interests, such as the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BGA) or the trade union representing workers in mining, chemicals and energy (IGBCE). While a detailed analysis of the decision-making dynamics within the commission is beyond this paper's scope, the strong representation of incumbent interests within the commission highlights an important institutional barrier against overcoming energy path dependence. Further work in this area could investigate the ability of corporatist styles of decision-making to reform today's carbon-intensive energy systems46. To successfully manage \u201cthe next phase of the energy transition\u201d47, which implies making established technologies and infrastructures redundant, we need to enhance our understanding of incumbents' survival strategies, including their corporate political activity aimed at slowing down the transition. Moreover, given the prevalence of particular stakeholders who stress job losses rather than new opportunities, the nexus between employment considerations and the political feasibility of decarbonization measures needs more scholarly attention8,48. Energy transition researchers and modellers would benefit from engaging with political scientists and sociologists to unveil the interests and activities of various actors who are shaping energy policies. Policymakers trying to develop ambitious climate change mitigation policies should be encouraged to find ways of being exposed to a balanced view of the risks and opportunities of the energy transition.

Second, it optimizes on the basis of linked but independent simulation models developed by different disciplines.

While the entry of these new types of contractual relation into the energy market may be disruptive by itself, it also poses at least three specific challenges to the UK sector, which under similar demographics and market conditions may be present in other liberalized, decarbonizing power sectors. First, there is the potential for market innovation to stall due to the most receptive segments being most likely to rent and the most disengaged segments being most likely to own homes and have the power to opt for contracts that include building alteration. Second, there is a social trust barrier to overcome in the energy sector, with low confidence across societal institutions for some segments. Finally, there is a real risk that the culmination of these issues could lock out some sectors of society, including low-income, low-information and renting demographics, from participating in low-carbon transitions. As the market diversifies and contracts become more complex, consumers may rely even more on heuristics to make decisions, introducing more complex consumer risks.

We have shown that this storyline of the climate, development and inequality nexus reverses when progressive revenue recycling is taken into account. Our approach corrects a long-standing bias against strong  immediate climate action. We find that with progressive revenue recycling, aggressive climate action can pay large dividends for improving well-being, reducing inequality and alleviating poverty. In an optimal policy calculation, the recommended policy is characterized by aggressive near-term climate action followed by a slower climb towards full decarbonization; this pattern prevents runaway warming while also preserving tax revenues for redistribution. The benefits from progressive use of carbon revenues are most pronounced in the early decades, when the revenues are largest and the needs of the poor are most urgent.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 86}

Cooperative adaptive management of the Nile can help alleviate some of these stressors and tensions. Here we present a planning framework for adaptive management of the Nile infrastructure system, combining climate projections; hydrological, river system and economy-wide simulators; and artificial intelligence multi-objective design and machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by designing a cooperative adaptive management policy for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that balances the transboundary economic and biophysical interests of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. This shows that if the three countries compromise cooperatively and adaptively in managing the dam, the national-level economic and resilience benefits are substantial, especially under climate projections with the most extreme streamflow changes.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 94}

But this work is needed. Contact with the criminal justice system\u2014stops, arrests, and jail and prison stays\u2014is disproportionately felt by African Americans owing to a legacy of discrimination and marginalization in a racialized society. Whether the linkage between incarceration and adverse health outcomes differs by race is the focus of ongoing research (Boen 2020; Semenza et al. 2021). The findings from this study suggest ways forward with research on health disparities, particularly biological markers. As noted, epigenetic aging indices are thought to be direct measures of the biological weathering conceptualized in Geronimus and colleagues' (2006) model of health inequalities (see Simons et al. 2021). Perhaps, then, epigenetic aging serves as a biological mechanism through which disparities in incarceration contribute to racial differences in chronic morbidity and excess mortality. Note, however, that we are unable to test this possibility given our reliance on an African American sample. Future research should examine the validity of this assumption given that it might hold important clues about how mass incarceration and other racerelated social adversities combine to affect health inequalities. Modern medicine often considers differences in health risk behaviors (e.g., diet) as the major cause of class and race disparities in chronic illness (Milani and Lavie 2015). Some argue that this view perhaps exaggerates the importance of health risk behaviors as a cause of health inequalities. Our findings show that regardless of diet, exercise, and smoking, incarceration exposure is a significant social determinant of accelerated aging.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 95}

A recent survey of utility-scale wind and solar developers found that they consider local zoning ordinances and  community opposition to be two of the biggest reasons for project delays and cancellations56. Thus, it matters that local elected officials have accurate perceptions of public preferences when they hold decision-making power about these projects. Local elected officials also report perceptions of their constituents' preferences in line with their own, underestimating support for solar projects. This suggests a disconnect between local elected officials and their constituents who appear more tolerant and interested in renewable energy projects like solar, and echoes other studies that find that local elected officials misperceive public preferences regarding climate policy57.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 96}

Activity-based indicators, which represent 84% of all indicators mapped, are needed for understanding progress in implementation; however, complementary outcome indicators are needed to track effectiveness36,37 and facilitate enhanced result reporting in future Adcom8. Further development of effectiveness indicators can be inspired by existing examples in NDCs and NAPs (Table 1) but also by existing objective-level targets (Extended Data Table 7), which can facilitate the identification of outcome-based indicators that align with established national priorities. Similarly, the adaptation cycle framework highlights the importance of identifying and tracking climate risk indicators to determine whether actions effectively reduce climatic risks. While such indicators are probably embedded in specialized institutional structures for weather and climate observation, they need to be acknowledged and integrated in planning processes to ensure consistency with national priorities and enable effective adaptation tracking. Lastly, improvements in indicator quality along the SMART+ criteria, particularly specificity, data sources, targets and timeframes, are warranted to ensure meaningful and practical indicators. Our analysis indicates that countries seeking to operationalize tracking are typically already moving in  the direction of contextually relevant and measurable indicators. This sets a valuable precedent. The recent decision of the IPCC on the Seventh Assessment Cycle38 and the UAE-Bel\u00e9m Work Program offer momentum for enhanced guidance on how governments can increase coherence between nationally relevant indicators and the GGA.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 97}

Multicountry studies evaluating associations between wildfire fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and respiratory hospitalizations are lacking. Here we evaluate the short-term effects of wildfire-specific PM2.5 on respiratory hospitalizations from 1,052 communities across Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan, during 2000-2019. A 1 \u00b5g m-3 increase in wildfire-specific PM2.5 was associated with increased hospitalization risks for all-cause respiratory, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute upper respiratory infection, influenza and pneumonia by 0.36%, 0.48%, 0.38%, 0.42%, 0.79% and 0.36%, respectively. Higher risks were observed among populations \u226419 or \u226560 years old, from low-income or high non-wildfire PM2.5 communities, and residing in Brazil, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam. Australia and New Zealand exhibited a greater hospitalization risk for asthma associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5 . Compared with non-wildfire PM2.5 , wildfire-specific PM2.5 posed greater hospitalization risks for all respiratory diseases and a greater burden of asthma. Wildfire-specific PM2.5 contributed to 42.4% of PM2.5-linked respiratory hospitalizations, dominating in Thailand. Overall, the substantial contribution of wildfire-specific PM2.5 to respiratory hospitalizations demands continued mitigation and adaptation efforts across most countries.

Although newer alternatives that might become viable in the future were not explicitly modelled, our analysis can inform policy of the price points and income levels at which populations in different regions will be able to afford new fuels and technologies. Because cooking behaviours appear to be quite persistent, future research should consider using panel or pseudo-panel datasets that can better capture longitudinal shifts. Our analysis could also be further expanded to better assess how societal changes, such as better education and women's empowerment and labour force participation, relate to cooking energy choices. We did not include institutional capacity and governance constraints that might limit the expansion of supply of certain cooking options or the effectiveness of policies in specific contexts. In addition, our analysis did not assume any climate feedback on biomass availability.

Clarity on whether residual emissions are a temporary condition or a permanent state is important, both for calibrating expectations for the future of the fossil fuel sector and for understanding the intended role for carbon removal. If negative-emission capacity is being used to compensate for residual emissions domestically or in another country, it is not available for legacy carbon removal or coping with overshoot. Although the AR62 frames these roles of carbon removal as complementary, they may be in conflict if we assume carbon-removal potential will be limited for social and sustainability reasons. Clarity on the temporality of residual emissions is also important because strategies such as soil carbon sequestration have apparently high mid-century technical potential, but these sinks saturate after ~20 years and require ongoing maintenance14. Land-based sinks already accounted for may saturate over time, as may carbon stored in products. Net zero needs to be a durable state22, not something that might be achieved and then be lost again. The timing of various carbon-removal strategies needs to be better planned for, and the ability to do so hinges on understanding  whether net zero is a stopgap or permanent state. While governments will have a challenging time being explicit about this, given their need to address multiple domestic actors, the research institutions and NGOs working in policy have more flexibility to be explicit about this in their analyses and can spell out the implications of treating residual emissions as continuing versus temporary.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 104}

Lack of clear information about legislation and how it applies to patient care was a prominent theme from our focus groups.

Professional societies and advocacy organizations preparing recommendations for providers should also consider that institutional policies can vary and contribute to uncertainty.

A careful approach to tradeintegration covering different types of trade barriers can furtherlimit hunger risks. The full removal of agricultural tariffs leadsto increases in food availability in SSA, MNA and EAS, but mayincrease exports and lower regional food availability in SEA andSAS. Further trade facilitation can reduce undernourishment inall hunger-affected regions. However, the effective realization oftrade facilitation requires considerable investments in transportinfrastructure and technology. Especially in low-income regions,such as SSA, infrastructure is weak36. An estimated US$130-170billion a year is needed to bridge the infrastructure gap in SSAby 2025 (ref.37).

Excluding comparably easy-to-monitor domestic resources might lead to a substantially higher cost of the energy system and to a higher demand for imported biomass and dedicated crops, with harder-to-foresee environmental consequences. As has been shown here, biomass usage, combined with carbon capture, is cost effective as long as net upstream emissions are relatively small or if negative emissions counteract limited upstream emissions. Exclusions of biomass sources such as primary forest residues thus need to be weighed against the targets in the energy sector and the potential to achieve negative emissions and gauged towards achieved capacity expansion speeds for VRE and electrolysis, which require an unprecedented ramp-up to achieve the results presented here already if biomass is not restricted.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 110}

Policy efforts from Brittany's community or school to change one of her health behaviors are unlikely to succeed unless they engage with her broader health lifestyle, its links to both her present and future, her parents' deep identity investment, her own identity expression, and the lifestyle's embeddedness within localized community norms. A successful effort to change Brittany's behavior must therefore move well beyond the individual child and her family\u2014 which is harder to implement but potentially much more effective. This empirical reality could translate into starkly different policy approaches to intervening in social inequalities and children's health.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 115}

The policy insight that emerges from this analysis is that national mandates such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard might not maximize even renewable energy production let alone environmental benefits. Likewise, renewable portfolio standards, a widely employed policy in the electricity sector, could lead to suboptimal use of waste biomass. In the literature, bioenergy and biofuel policies have been analysed mainly from the perspective of climatechange mitigation, food security or cost, but this analysis shows that  they also do not optimize energy production. From a methodological perspective, this analysis illustrates the value of combining LCA with spatial analytical techniques for multicriterion assessment of alternative conversion pathways and the identification of hotspots for the refinement of existing energy policies. Indexing volumetric targets and mandates as well as financial subsidies for renewable energy to life-cycle emission-based performance measures will lead to more sustainable use of wastes and biomass residues.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 116}

The result reinforces the hypothesis that audits, by themselves, provide only limited incentive to invest in energy efficiency upgrades. Ultimately, building owners remain constrained by factors that audit information alone may not overcome, such as limited access to capital, uncertainty in savings projections, opportunity costs and weak pricing signals in energy markets.To begin to address these economic and behavioural barriers, cities need to develop a comprehensive strategy to support energy efficiency in the building sector that starts with a foundation of data transparency and rigorous analytics. Energy disclosure mandates are an important first step: once the data are available, buildings can be evaluated on their energy performance and compared with their peers, which creates a 'grading' scheme that can help to shift individual and collective decision-making56. Following this, cities can consider performance targets and provide financial and regulatory incentives to motivate building owners to improve their energy efficiency and also ensure that regulations are in place to require poorly performing buildings to improve when owners do not respond to incentives. Audit requirements, then, could be used to target deep retrofits, focusing on ECM opportunities that could achieve 30% or greater savings, and automated or virtual audits could replace the existing need for traditional audit mandates. Similarly, because audit policies produce significant data on building systems and operating characteristics\u2014information that is useful for a range of city agencies, but often difficult to collect-mandatory requirements could be replaced by incentives for voluntarily reporting audit data.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 118}

First, whereas public grants are not significant drivers of outcomes on their own, they probably act as catalysts for startups that work on difficult sectors before they advance and acquire capital through corporate or other private investors (Fig. 2). Publicly funded startups exit at a higher rate with the addition of corporate investment (155% increase) compared with other private investment (78% increase) (Model 2). This suggests that increasing public grant funding at both the national (for example, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)) and regional (for example, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority) level is critical to de-risk technologies and create opportunities for beneficial public-private partnership. Second, corporate investors' association with positive outcomes for grant recipients and high-patenting startups (compared with other private investors) highlights the importance of incentivizing these investors to mobilize capital to invest in startups. Policymakers can build on successes from networks enabled through key grant agencies (for example, the ARPA-E annual summit) to create opportunities for high-risk startups. In addition, public-private partnerships (for example, the First Movers Coalition focused on aviation, steel and other key technologies) could create similar opportunities in other regions or technologies. Third, the association between both corporate and other private investment and increased rates of failure means that policymakers should act to minimize harmful practices such as intellectual property misappropriation (for example, misappropriation of the startups' knowledge by the larger corporate partner, also known as 'corporate sharks')22,37.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 119}

From  a Durkheimian perspective, it is unsurprising that we observe consequences of such rapid and all- encompassing social change for integration and, ultimately, population health. In times of great turbulence and social disruption, it is critical to maintain meaningful social ties, but sustaining those bonds becomes increasingly more difficult, resulting in challenges to mental health. As the pandemic accelerated, we began to observe the expected fallout for social life and mental health. However, the patterns are not equivalent across age. Subjective social isolation increased more dramatically during this period among older respondents, leading to a more substantial rise in psychological distress during this period. This research therefore presents an important qualification to a Durkheimian perspective by demonstrating that a life course context plays a crucial role in differentiating individual vulnerability to disintegrative large-scale social forces and their consequences for mental health.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 120}

The increased income leads to an increased demand for fuel. However, since the cash can be spent on anything, most of it is used for other things. Hence, the fuel price increases only marginally (1.1 cents in the very short term and much less in the long term). One perspective on this, which highlights the main benefit of cash transfers compared with fuel-tax cuts, is that consumers, through these policies, receive the equivalent of 20 cents per litre of fuel consumed on average. To receive the benefits of a tax cut, consumers have to buy fuel. If they receive it in the form of cash instead, they can choose to spend it all on fuel, to spend none of it on fuel or somewhere in between; cash is a more flexible currency than a tax cut. Even a person who spends the whole transfer on fuel will gain from a cash transfer since the fuel price increases only by 1.1 cents. Therefore, this allows for varying preferences in the population (it is also possible to direct the cash to particular groups that are hit harder by the price increase; see 'Theoretical approach'). Another benefit of a cash transfer is that it avoids decreasing the fuel tax (that is, a Pigouvian tax), thus abating climate concerns.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 121}

However, the magnitude of the remaining unaffordability increases substantially to an average of US$2,000 per year per household. These findings indicate that although risk-based premiums are lower than  current NFIP premiums for many households, moving towards risk-based premiums implies a sharp increase in premiums and  unaffordability for a subgroup of households living in high-risk areas. Unaffordability issues can potentially be overcome by offering  insurance vouchers and providing inexpensive accessible loans for financing DRR measures by low-income households currently living in high flood risk zones7. Alternatively, further incentivizing DRR by homeowners would make more people eligible for premium discounts. Relocation or managed retreat might also become necessary2. As seen in Fig. 1e, continuation of the program without anticipating climate change or socio-economic development will further increase the  debt of the NFIP by ~60% (from US$20.5 billion to US$32.8 billion). Introducing risk-based premiums will significantly limit the rise in future debt but will not solve the problem entirely (debt will increase by 28% instead of 60%).

Those who experienced violence were more than 2 years older than their calendar age. This effect, however, was exclusive to direct incidents of violent threats, assaults with and without weapons, and robbery. Interpersonal violence likely engenders a stress response that chronically activates immunological and nervous system capacities. This evidence aligns with the literature on prison violence and mental health (Zweig et al. 2015). Moreover, it accords with research indicating that threatening social environments trigger adverse physiological responses (Miller et al. 2011; Simons et al. 2021). Perhaps violent victimization is especially stressful in the confined spaces of the prison context where hostile interpersonal relations are particularly difficult to circumvent.

Hence, achieving net-zero GHG emissions beyond 2030 and continued decarbonization over the longer term will require the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies38,39 to offset these emissions. Our pathways assume the availability of CDR technologies such as bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC) in addition to terrestrial sinks40 and assume that the relative roles of CDR deployment versus mitigation in other sectors largely depend on economics. Although the scale of CDR in our pathways is consistent with the extant literature (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10), an important caveat that could affect the feasibility and scale of  CDR deployment that is not fully accounted for in our pathways is that they could interact with societal priorities other than climate, creating varying degrees of synergies and tradeoffs depending on the type and scale of CDR measures used41-44. In addition, since not all countries are equally endowed with CDR potential, achieving net-zero pledges and ratcheting ambition might need to be supported by cooperative strategies and/or trade38,45. A simple sensitivity analysis that explores the implications of limited CDR availability suggests that the high ambition pathways explored in this study are feasible under no availability of DAC but that results in greater reductions in CO2 emissions from energy and industrial sectors (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12).

This may be driven, in part, by the perceived uncertainty around energy retrofit investments, and thus inflate the required rate of return (or hurdle rate) for energy investments when compared with more traditional building improvements. Building owners, then, may lack sufficient economic incentive, in the absence of strong energy pricing signals, public incentives or regulatory mandates, to implement energy improvements over other capital improvements33.It is important for local policymakers to understand whether this is, indeed, a barrier to the implementation of recommended ECMs. If so, cities will need to strengthen the incentives for efficiency improvements before audit mandates can have a significant impact. For instance, to require property owners to assess more ambitious ECMs in their audits, as has been proposed (for example, NYC's One City Built to Last sustainability plan52), will not lead to actual energy savings if property owners do not have an incentive, and the access to capital, to invest in energy efficiency in the first place.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 131}

This paper provides a step forward in that direction by combining an empirical-based, spatially explicit energy production model with state-of-the-art air pollution transport modelling to quantify health benefits at a fine spatial scale and an employment model to quantify local labour-market consequences. Our framework can be applied to other decarbonization policies at various scales such as studying the distributional consequences of decarbonizing other forms of fossil fuel extraction, electricity production or manufacturing activity.

However, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol scope 2 guidance argues that the use of non-additional market-based instruments is not a problem as the main goal is to allocate total grid emissions to individual consumers9. From that perspective, individual companies can legitimately use RECs to report emissions reductions that do not reflect a global emission reduction, as the market-based emissions of all energy users on the grid sum to total grid emissions. Based on our analysis, we encourage the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to reconsider its stance on additionality for two reasons. First, as many corporate energy users do not report emissions (nor do residential households), a company's purchase of non-additional RECs effectively increases the market-based emissions of other actors  that do not report emissions (through an increase in the residual  emission factor; see Box 1). This means that total reported market-based emissions will always overstate the actual grid-total emissions reduction due to incomplete reporting. Second, as companies increasingly disclose emissions in the context of targets informed by the need to reduce global emissions (SBTs5 and net-zero targets34,35), it is clearly misleading to stakeholders if companies can meet these targets without reducing global emissions. This would also be the case in a situation with complete reporting. We acknowledge that this second issue raises a related and broader limitation with the use of standard corporate emissions accounting (whether market- or location-based), in that changes in emissions outside of the scopes 1, 2 and 3 accounting boundary are not shown. Apparent reductions within the boundary may therefore not reflect total reductions in global emissions. For example, a company's decision to use bioenergy may cause emissions outside its value chain through indirect land use change36. Accordingly, SBTi should consider options for complementing standard scopes 1, 2 and 3 accounts with consequential emission accounting methods36 to ensure that actions taken to achieve STBs do not unintentionally increase emissions outside the  accounting boundary.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 135}

Complementary innovation policies, such as increased funding for demonstration and commercialization, in-kind support from national laboratories and targeted procurement programmes, may be needed to allow scale-up beyond the R&D phase and to ensure that cleantech innovations can leverage additional private financing and transition to the market.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 136}

For these reasons, we expect our results to generalize to energy subsidy programmes seen globally that provide low-income homeowners subsidies for high-value goods like home retrofits2-6, heating equipment3-5,7-9 and efficiency upgrades3,5,7,9. Like the solar programme we studied, such programmes often involve high interaction between the programme provider and participating households, which might strengthen the feeling of obligation to comply with the reciprocity appeal.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 137}

Separating reality from hype requires a hard look at the most aggressive claims in terms of costs, risks and returns\u2014 the factors that really matter to developers, banks, and providers and consumers of electricity. Solar costs vary widely by region, and fully explaining this variation requires an understanding of local conditions, which we have sought to provide as context for the recent record-low solar electricity prices and bids in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and their subsequent extensions to other regions. We have demonstrated here that unsubsidized prices below 3\u00a2 kWh-1 are attainable when the right combination of local conditions is realized, and that the minimum for solar prices should be expected to continue dropping (with some slowing expected as interest rates rise) with hardware costs, barring some significant change in the financial sector's perception of solar's profitability. While certain costs do seem to have been mitigated in the case of the  Gulf projects, which could be argued to be a subsidy, the success of projects in other regions at achieving comparable savings indicates that these costs can be significantly reduced by skilful engineering, without state intervention. We wish to emphasize that government policy remains an important element to remove barriers to PV deployment, chief among which is the need for access to cheap financing. As global interest rates are expected to rise, it becomes more critical for solar projects to be able to prove themselves as low risk to achieve favourable financing packages. The clear commitment to renewable energy as state policy (as well as the involvement of large public or semi-public companies in the development of PV projects) was certainly a factor in providing the necessary degree of confidence that allowed banks to overcome their historical aversion to renewable energy projects32 and begin lending at low rates in the Gulf. Such a mentality of strategic energy planning, whereby governments intervene not to subsidize but merely to enable and encourage investment in technologies that are believed to be of value to the society, is an essential element of low electricity prices and may provide guidance regarding how to continue the spread of low solar prices into other markets.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 138}

However, this valuable resource was not distributed evenly across urban areas, with limited access to populations already at risk for complications from the virus. Although state public health officials implemented eligibility systems that prioritized health care workers, the elderly, and those with medical comorbidities, the geographic component of the vaccine rollout and allocation of the vaccine over time has not been equal.

Within this context, we find that the extension of the legal right to drive to undocumented immigrants is associated with health benefits for the children of Mexican and Central American immigrants.

First, lifestyle changes should be better integrated into scenarios61-66. Reducing or shifting energy services demand requires widespread changes in social norms to induce more sustainable lifestyles, as discussed and modelled in Supplementary Information 13. These can only partially be achieved by policies and strongly depend on available organizations and infrastructures67,68. Second, further developments should enhance the linkage between demand sectors and industrial and  material demands22. Strengthening this connection would enable a more complete evaluation of emissions across the supply chain. Third, IAMs do not adequately consider local infrastructural challenges, particularly those related to the power grid. Additional assessments using more detailed models, such as power dispatch models, can help to identify risks, such as increased likelihood of blackouts69, that could impede consumer adoption.The success of policies depends on their broader support in society. Measures aimed at behavioural and lifestyle changes, but also interventions such as taxing air travel and restricting low-cost carbon-intensive technologies that directly influence affordability might face resistance. Our study, which assumes that policies are fully effective, does not account for the potential resistance and partial implementation that could affect the outcomes. Therefore, future research should also delve into the impact of these measures on macroeconomics, ensuring that policies are not only effective but also sustainable in their broader socio-economic context.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 142}

We check how many households in the sample also tend to have increasing costs under some of the scenarios while experience cost savings in others. We find that 321 households face lower costs in scenario e100 and higher costs in scenario pa100, which means that nearly 40% of the households consume relatively moderate volumes of energy in total, but at the same time frequently produce significant peak loads. This example demonstrates that a different weighting of the volumetric, peak and fixed components can have strongly diametrical effects on the network expenditures of individual households.

It can be noted that Russia's profits under a cash transfer are also substantially lower when compared with the lowest profits of a tax cut considered in the sensitivity analysis (see Supplementary Note 2).The conclusion that an income transfer yields much lower Russian profits is not likely to change even if we consider other expenditures of households in the EU. The reason for this is that an income elasticity of 1, as we use here15, implies that fuel's share of income is constant when income increases. Put differently, since private road-transport fuels correspond to 7% of consumer spending in the EU (figure for 2008 from ref. 16), only 7% of the cash transfer would go to road fuel. Transport accounts for 13.2% of households' expenditures17, not all of which goes to oil products. Elasticity for other transport is not very different from that for road fuels (for aviation income, elasticity is around 1 (ref. 18)). Hence, the amount of cash transfer that may go to oil products is effectively capped by oil's cost share in the EU. Elasticities for other categories of consumer spending vary. For food, elasticity is around 0.5 in the EU19 and it accounts for 14.8% of expenditures, while housing-related expenditures correspond to 25.7% (a small share of which is gas for heating). Various smaller categories correspond to the remaining 48% (ref. 20).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 144}

This decrease in Africa is higher in protected areas and concessions, suggesting that alerts either increased capacity to enforce existing deforestation policy or induced the development of more effective anti-deforestation policies.

We find that the capacity expansion plans as envisioned in the NECPs would lead to a reduction of the \u03b2-sensitivity to natural gas prices from 1.4 euros to 1 euro, which, in turn, would lower the extremes in prices that could be expected in the future. However, we find that the resulting improvement falls short of what would be required if the policy goal is to be close to independence from the prices of natural gas. Reducing the \u03b2-sensitivity to less than 0.5 euros would require deploying 30% more renewables by 2030, and going below 0.25 euros would require 60% additional deployment versus the currently envisioned target. These are very large changes. Moreover, further increasing the capacity of renewable technologies, while lowering the sensitivity and improving the stability of electricity prices, results in cannibalization conditions that would be associated with low market revenue for renewable producers in day-ahead markets.

The actions taken by federal and state governments in the United States have primarily focused on the practices of pharmaceutical companies and prescribing physicians (Gross and Gordon 2019). Although we find that addressing the supply side of the epidemic is necessary\u2014it is an inadequate prevention response by itself (also see Monnat 2019; Peters et al. 2019). Policymakers must also address structural factors like economic inequality, which will require implementing policies that redistribute income and resources. Although wealth is not explicitly discussed in this article, implementing a wealth tax may be an even more effective strategy because the wealthiest often structure their assets so they have relatively low levels of taxable income (Saez and Zucman 2019). Furthermore, eliminating private insurance and moving to a single-payer system could potentially not only check the power of pharmaceutical companies and limit the harmful prescribing practices of physicians but also serve as a large pay increase for employees.

In November 2016, the German government adopted the Climate Action Plan 2050, outlining measures to achieve the country's climate targets. This plan failed to develop a phase-out strategy, and in 2018 the task was delegated to the Coal Commission, an expert commission on growth, structural change and employment consisting of a variety of  stakeholders including industry associations, labour unions, statelevel governments, environmental non-governmental organizations and independent scientists appointed by the federal government. In early 2019, this group recommended to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2038, proposing an array of measures to support the coal regions in restructuring their economies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 158}

To prevent this, a global minimum tax policy was approved by OECD countries in 2021. Global changes in corporate tax rates could reshape production and investment networks while impacting welfare and global emission patterns. Here we develop a theoretical multi-country multi-industry general equilibrium model and show that global corporate tax competition during 2005-2016 would increase global carbon emissions and shift more emissions to developing economies. Implementing a global minimum tax rate of 15% would reduce global carbon emissions and effectively decrease the developing economies' emissions.

They are generally aimed at solving enduring social problems that compromise the health and well-being of populations, especially vulnerable populations. For instance, environmental policies protect populations by limiting exposure to toxins. Health and welfare policies support the sick and poor through financial assistance and the provision of needed services. Civil rights policies empower socially marginalized groups by legislating against widespread institutional discrimination. Educational spending invests in the human capital of workers and the future of state economies. In addition, a body of research using cross-national data shows that social democratic welfare state regimes offer more social protection, including health care access, and tend to have better population health outcomes than their less liberal counterparts (e.g., Beckfield and Bambra 2016; Brennenstuhl et al. 2012).

As the sum of collected revenues from all households together is required to remain unchanged under any new tariff scheme, a reduction of the financial contribution of higher-income households would automatically mean an increase of burdens for lower-income households compared with the situation under the reference scenario. As such distributional effects are problematic from a public choice perspective, it is important to identify whether certain tariff scenarios are actually associated with shifting burdens towards households with lower incomes.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 162}

Eight days later, a second vaccine, Moderna, was approved for use in individuals ages 18 and older. However, distribution of the vaccine has been a logistical hurdle necessitating extremely low temperature cold storage and personnel needs, all while having to maintain COVID-19  safety protocols. For example, unpunctured vials of the vaccines must be kept between -90\u00b0C and -60\u00b0C for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and between -50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C for the Moderna vaccine, well below the temperature of a standard freezer. An obvious question that has emerged is how to do this equitably, especially when vaccine supply is low. Roughly following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2020a), in the case of Texas, which is focus of this analysis, Phase 1A of the rollout was reserved for frontline health care workers, residents of long-term nursing facilities for the elderly, and workers in those same facilities. Phase 1B included people ages 65 and above and people ages 16 and above with at least one comorbidity defined by the state as being particularly vulnerable for the disease, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, chronic heart disease, and so on. Although the goal was to equitably distribute vaccine doses to reach the vulnerable, the question remains whether this goal was met.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 163}

For climate change, followership is particularly critical to effective policy, because the jurisdictions that are willing to lead on climate policy account for just a tiny fraction of global emissions47. In our analysis, followership is especially needed in the medium-supporting states, given their large contribution to national total emissions. The largest differences between leader and follower units arise with so-called harder-to-abate sectors such as industrial heating, buildings and transportation48. For policymakers, this suggests that there is a very high premium on advances in decarbonization of these sectors, because followership will be hardest in these domains. If leaders can, through testing and deployment in their local markets, reduce abatement costs in these other sectors, they could make followership much easier and increase total leverage on emissions. For analysts, the role of these sectors in follower jurisdictions suggests that we need to analyse the real potential for improved decarbonization performance in these sectors in greater depth. Where leadership can plausibly reduce costs, the model of heterogeneous policymaking can be particularly advantageous; where not, it could lead to policy cul-de-sacs, where followers never follow and world emissions remain stuck at high levels.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 164}

Rather, our result provides evidence of interactions between the policies targeting population aging and climate change, highlighting the importance of synergizing these two types of policies.

There are several possible areas of collision between punitive state and medical systems. Future global health crises are expected to become more frequent and destructive and will likely necessitate strong partnerships between public health, medicine, and the state. Furthermore, the increasing politicization of health care access and rights for marginalized groups, including efforts to limit health care access to immigrants and transgender people, and ongoing efforts to restrict access to abortion services will likely create myriad opportunities for health care workers to enforce laws, actively challenge them, or ignore them. Finally, researchers and practitioners should examine the day-to-day criminalization of health care, including practices such as forensic testing, mandated reporting, sharing private medical records for prosecutorial purposes, and court- mandated or coerced treatment. How medical actors mobilize law and exercise discretion reflects larger population control methods and reveals new vulnerable populations and social fault lines at the interstices of medicine and punitive state systems.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 167}

Australia's regulatory agencies charged with governing electricity retail protections could take this role.

Whereas these earlier studies only include CCS, this study also includes CCU and finds both very valuable to enable high carbon efficiencies in a renewable energy system. Allowing more fossil fuel usage compensated through CDR did not substantially affect near-optimal biomass usage (in contrast to Grant et al.48), but it was found to reduce the competitiveness of using captured carbon to produce electrofuels (CCU), in favour of sequestering it (CCS). In fact, failing to apply carbon capture resulted in a considerably reduced value of using biomass in the energy system. Owing to its high investment cost, carbon capture was found to be cost effective in processes running with high utilization rates and not in applications managing the integration of variable renewable electricity.A net-negative target for the European energy system is probably needed to reach territorial net-zero emissions, considering that residual emissions in other sectors need to be compensated; this might exert a substantial demand pull for biomass, especially if VRE and electrolyser deployment falls behind expectations. The resulting level of biomass usage may even exceed the lower end of estimated global biomass residue potentials, which spans a wide range of 3-21 PWh per year (ref. 110).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 173}

The use of multiple pharmaceuticals has increased over time, in tandem with the increasing intensity of medical intervention (Aronowitz 2012; Swinglehurst and Fudge 2017), a pattern some refer to as \u201cpharmaceuticalization\u201d in reference to the parallel concept of medicalization (Abraham 2010). Polypharmacy itself has been linked to adverse events and nonadherence, and there has been some discussion on how to assist physicians in managing the practice (Grando et al. 2012). Yet little is known about multiple morbidity per se or the ways in which the treatment of one disease has consequences for another, in large part because medical science continues to be organized around discrete disease categories. It is unlikely that medical treatment always involves complementarities between diseases. Some evidence points to a rise, for instance, in emergency room visits for adverse effects of medical treatment (Bernstein et al. 2003). But a lack of complementarities is perhaps especially likely when mental illness has consistently played a secondary role to physical illness. The scope of the side-effects issue is broad, and future research should consider the role of pharmaceutical side effects in other psychiatric disorders, including side effects related to anxiety, confusion, and psychotic syndromes.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 179}

Even the most well-intentioned map-making risks obscuring or misrepresenting procedural, distributive and recognition injustices for specific communities and/or individuals. Moreover, regulation undergoes frequent iteration, and there were numerous changes proposed, in draft form or in the process of introduction during this review. We seek to dispel here any perception of a deficit narrative of Australian rurality and acknowledge the efforts of the many individuals, communities, advocates, utilities and policymakers engaged in finding local solutions and alternatives to the challenges identified here. Methodologically, we recognize that identifying underserved communities with a simple count of regulations provided does not capture the potential for regulations to have differing extents and magnitudes of impact. We opted for a simple count as the most transparent indicator of locations facing disadvantage in multiple areas, while mindful that this may not fully capture regulation in each practical application. Finally, we note that the situation in Australia is unique to this country, its history, demography and geography.

Findings suggest that postsecondary education does not improve mother's health, except for reduced smoking among mothers with high school degrees or less that earned bachelor's degrees. These findings inform health policy debates and theories linking education to health.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 181}

As the winterization of new capacity is cheaper and easier to implement than the winterization of existing capacity, winterization standards for installing new power plants and associated infrastructure should have a high priority.

However, the effect of different land-use and energy sector policies on specific bioenergy emissions has not been studied so far. Using the global integrated assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE, we derive a biofuel emission factor (EF) for different policy frameworks. We find that a uniform price on emissions from both sectors keeps biofuel emissions at 12 kg CO2 GJ-1. However, without land-use regulation, the EF increases substantially (64 kg CO2 GJ-1 over 80 years, 92 kg CO2 GJ-1 over 30 years). We also find that comprehensive coverage (>90%) of carbon-rich land areas worldwide is key to containing land-use emissions. Pricing emissions indirectly on the level of bioenergy consumption reduces total emissions by cutting bioenergy demand but fails to reduce the average EF. In the absence of comprehensive and timely land-use regulation, bioenergy thus may contribute less to climate change mitigation than assumed previously.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 184}

It starts from a state with low policy credibility due to the huge certificate surplus, myopic market actors and ensuing low carbon prices. Then, the MSR reform and the higher ambition in the 'Fit for 55' package substantially strengthened the policy credibility and set in motion a reinforcing cycle: actors extend their foresight horizon, which in turn increases carbon prices, which (1) may increase the policy credibility and (2) attracts non-compliance actors to the market with at least partially more long-term investment strategies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 185}

These reductions appear to translate into substantially fewer asthma-related ERVs and hospitalizations, as well as fewer average daily SABA uses. Given that 20.4 million adults, or about 9% of the population, suffered from current asthma in 201649, the shift in US energy trends away from coal-fired electricity generation may reduce asthma morbidity below otherwise expected levels. Future research should evaluate this potential impact so that plant controls and retirement sites can be phased to affect neighbourhoods and schools at the highest risk for asthma.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 186}

Historically burdened with caregiving and household duties, women's engagement in the labor market has been significantly influenced by defamilization policies. These policies aim to reduce the caregiving responsibilities traditionally assigned to women, enhancing their autonomy and ability to participate fully in the labor force. Such measures help balance work and family life and lessen financial dependence within families (Bambra 2007; Chau et al. 2017; Lohmann and Zagel 2016). The effectiveness of defamilization policies is evident in their capacity to redistribute paid and unpaid labor, which is vital for understanding how life course trajectories in work and family contexts impact health. For example, in environments with minimal defamilization support, women juggling intensive domestic and professional roles may face different mental health challenges compared to those in contexts with substantial state support for unpaid labor. Similarly, the mental health outcomes in traditional family settings with long-term labor force attachment can vary significantly depending on the level of defamilization.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 187}

In the short run, achieving rapid near-term hydrogen growth is crucial to keep 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios within reach. This requires strong policies, such as subsidies to directly bridge the cost gap, minimize investment risks and initialize a hydrogen market. However, as hydrogen technologies and markets mature, policy support should shift to market-based mechanisms to (1) reduce policy costs, (2) reveal the full hydrogen costs to markets and consumers, and (3) create a level playing field with other mitigation options. The most important technology-neutral strategy is ambitious carbon pricing. However, as carbon prices are currently too low and too uncertain in the future, complementary instruments are required to de-risk the remaining uncertainties. These include technology-neutral auctions of carbon contracts for difference57, which hedge investors against unpredictable prices by covering the difference between emissions abatement costs and carbon prices, as well as tradable, technology-neutral quotas for, for example, low-carbon materials, fostering green lead markets.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 189}

Given the difficulties in regulating the LU sector described above, this implies that bioenergy may play a much smaller role in climate change mitigation than suggested by most IAM scenarios2. The main driving force behind this challenge is the huge demand for non-electric energy, particularly transport fuels. Broad and deep electrification of end uses would thus lower the pressure on the land system and bypass the regulatory gaps in the LU sector60.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 190}

Future research should establish the responsible mechanisms for this study's findings. We assumed that union membership itself was the driver of older adulthood health outcomes. Yet unions have well-established influence on egalitarian state-level policy outcomes. To what extent does cumulative unionization reflect longer residence in more egalitarian policy environments? To what extent does unionization prevent early mortality? If unions help prevent death during one's career and improve health outcomes, our results might be conservative when considered alongside uneven mortality along unionization. More research on this topic is needed. The group with partially unionized careers consistently and surprisingly had the worst health outcomes. Although we control for many career characteristics, this group may experience significant unmeasured volatility, either life course or economic. In Appendix Table 1 in the online version of the article, we include descriptive information for this group compared to never and highly unionized groups. Although beyond the scope of the current study, this group deserves greater attention. Although the later life health disadvantages of partial union exposure imply longer-term consequences of career instability and changes, our findings do not rule out the possibility that union status might still provide contemporaneous health benefits for these workers.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 194}

Put simply, policy approaches aimed at controlling pathways to drug use through the medical system are less likely to meet the challenges of evolving drug markets. Foucault (1995) warns that state surveillance may shift to the criminal justice system where other institutions fail because criminal justice fills any gap in the perfection of self-governing behavior. Thus, the rise of fentanyl adulteration could mark a resurgence in prior emphases on criminalization approaches. However, even for illicit drugs, disproportionate reliance on criminalization is not a foregone conclusion. Expanding health systems for early intervention with people who use drugs and promoting access for drug-dependent persons to receive needed treatment services while still creating surveillance are likely preferable to an expansion of the coercive power of the criminal justice system. We may only reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use through sustained and comprehensive efforts of prevention, health promotion, clinical care, and treatment alongside policy implementation.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 197}

Although robust to different specifications, our results rest upon assumptions that, while common in the climate mitigation literature (for example, a single carbon market) or reasonable given the current policy environment (for example, private ownership of NET companies), depend on policy and ethical choices: who should finance, within and across societies, the provision of a global public good such as CO2 removal, who should own the means to provide this public good, and how to design policies which avoid unintended and detrimental consequences? Our findings suggest that, when confronted with these questions, policymakers designing institutions for effective and fair CO2 removal should focus on their distributional implications: policy provisions that affect the ownership structure and the market for NETs can mitigate the inequality concerns described here but require political capital and a sound understanding of the repercussion of these crucial climate strategies. Methodologically, the paper shows that, when evaluating decarbonization strategies, there is a need for models that are able to capture the interactions of technology and finance with societal goals such as inequality control.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 199}
