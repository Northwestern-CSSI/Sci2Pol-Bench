A list of such epitopes is provided.\nThe number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus.\nFor inducing protection, booster vaccinations enhancing existing immunity are less demanding than primary vaccinations against new antigens.\nTherefore, for the discussion on vaccination strategies against COVID-19, the available immune memory against related viruses should be part of the consideration.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"NEI\", \"evidence\": []}", "id": 276}

The short answer is YES\n\nAbstract:\nABSTRACT Introduction: Recent studies show cigarette smokers are markedly under-represented among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in over a dozen countries.\nIt is unclear if this may be related to confounding factors such as age distribution, access to care, and inaccurate records.\nWe hypothesized that these concerns could be avoided by studying smoking prevalence in relation to COVID-19 mortality.\nSince climate has been identified as a factor in COVID-19, we studied groups of countries with relatively comparable temperatures.\nMethods: The 20 hottest and 20 coldest countries in the Johns Hopkins Mortality Analysis database with a minimum mortality rate of .3 deaths/100,000 were selected on the basis of the average temperatures of their largest city.\nMortality rates were determined as of May 1, 2020 and correlated with national smoking rate adjusting for sex ratio, obesity, temperature, and elderly population.\nResults: A highly significant inverse correlation between current daily smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality rate was noted for the group of hot countries (R=-.718, p = .0002), cold countries (R=-.567, p=.0046), and the combined group (R=-.324, p=.0207).\nHowever, after adjustments only the regression for hot countries and the combined group remained significant.\nIn hot countries, for each percentage point increase in smoking rate mortality decreased by .147 per 100,000 population (95% CI .102- 192, p=.0066).\nThis resulted in mortality rates several-fold elevated in the countries with the lowest smoking rates relative to the highest smoking rates.\nIn the combined group, mortality decreased by .257 per 100,000 population (95% CI .175-.339, p=.0034).\nDiscussion: These findings add support to the finding of an inverse relationship between current smoking and seriously symptomatic COVID-19.\nHowever, we conclude that the difference in mortality between the highest and lowest smoking countries appears too large to be due primarily to the effects of smoking per se.\nA potentially beneficial effect of smoking is surprising, but compatible with a number of hypothetical mechanisms which deserve exploration: 1) Studies show smoking alters ACE2 expression which may affect COVID-19 infection or its progression to serious lung pathology.\n2) Nicotine has anti-inflammatory activity and also appears to alter ACE2 expression.\n3) Nitric oxide in cigarette smoke is known to be effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and has shown in vitro antiviral effects including against SARS-CoV-2.\n4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19.\n5) Smokers are exposed to hot vapors which may stimulate immunity in the respiratory tract by various heat-related mechanisms (e.g. heat shock proteins).\nStudies of steam and sauna treatments have shown efficacy in other viral respiratory conditions.\nAt this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized.\nThe interaction of smoking and COVID-19 will only be reliably determined by carefully designed prospective study, and there is reason to believe that there are unknown confounds that may be spuriously suggesting a protective effect of smoking.\nHowever, the magnitude of the apparent inverse association of COVID-19 and smoking and its myriad clinical implications suggest the importance of further investigation.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"CONTRADICT\", \"evidence\": [\"4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19.\", \"At this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized.\"]}", "id": 288}

Moreover, genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoVs.\nThis was further assessed by S gene recombination analysis.\nThese recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus.\nMoreover, positive selection pressure was detected between SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV isolates and human SARS-CoV isolates.\nHowever, the highest positive selection occurred between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and 2 bat-SL-CoV isolates (Bat-SL-RsSHC014 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45).\nThis further indicates that SARS-CoV-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat SARS-like isolates, and that a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic.\nThis study thuds sheds further light on the origin of this virus.\nAUTHOR SUMMARY The emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported.\nSaudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin.\nIn our analysis, SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen.\nRecombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.\nThe data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this virus.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae; Betacoronavirus) is the underlying cause of COVID-19 disease.\"]}", "id": 354}

While it's important to prevent getting COVID-19 in the first place, it's also essential that we do all we can to keep our lungs healthy to avoid the worst affects of the disease.\n\nAbstract:\nABSTRACT Introduction: Recent studies show cigarette smokers are markedly under-represented among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in over a dozen countries.\nIt is unclear if this may be related to confounding factors such as age distribution, access to care, and inaccurate records.\nWe hypothesized that these concerns could be avoided by studying smoking prevalence in relation to COVID-19 mortality.\nSince climate has been identified as a factor in COVID-19, we studied groups of countries with relatively comparable temperatures.\nMethods: The 20 hottest and 20 coldest countries in the Johns Hopkins Mortality Analysis database with a minimum mortality rate of .3 deaths/100,000 were selected on the basis of the average temperatures of their largest city.\nMortality rates were determined as of May 1, 2020 and correlated with national smoking rate adjusting for sex ratio, obesity, temperature, and elderly population.\nResults: A highly significant inverse correlation between current daily smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality rate was noted for the group of hot countries (R=-.718, p = .0002), cold countries (R=-.567, p=.0046), and the combined group (R=-.324, p=.0207).\nHowever, after adjustments only the regression for hot countries and the combined group remained significant.\nIn hot countries, for each percentage point increase in smoking rate mortality decreased by .147 per 100,000 population (95% CI .102- 192, p=.0066).\nThis resulted in mortality rates several-fold elevated in the countries with the lowest smoking rates relative to the highest smoking rates.\nIn the combined group, mortality decreased by .257 per 100,000 population (95% CI .175-.339, p=.0034).\nDiscussion: These findings add support to the finding of an inverse relationship between current smoking and seriously symptomatic COVID-19.\nHowever, we conclude that the difference in mortality between the highest and lowest smoking countries appears too large to be due primarily to the effects of smoking per se.\nA potentially beneficial effect of smoking is surprising, but compatible with a number of hypothetical mechanisms which deserve exploration: 1) Studies show smoking alters ACE2 expression which may affect COVID-19 infection or its progression to serious lung pathology.\n2) Nicotine has anti-inflammatory activity and also appears to alter ACE2 expression.\n3) Nitric oxide in cigarette smoke is known to be effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and has shown in vitro antiviral effects including against SARS-CoV-2.\n4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19.\n5) Smokers are exposed to hot vapors which may stimulate immunity in the respiratory tract by various heat-related mechanisms (e.g. heat shock proteins).\nStudies of steam and sauna treatments have shown efficacy in other viral respiratory conditions.\nAt this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized.\nThe interaction of smoking and COVID-19 will only be reliably determined by carefully designed prospective study, and there is reason to believe that there are unknown confounds that may be spuriously suggesting a protective effect of smoking.\nHowever, the magnitude of the apparent inverse association of COVID-19 and smoking and its myriad clinical implications suggest the importance of further investigation.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19.\", \"At this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized.\"]}", "id": 359}

High rates of COVID-19 infections in healthcare-workers (HCWs) have been reported from several countries.\nRespirators such as filtering face piece (FFP) 2 masks were designed to protect HCWs, while surgical masks were originally intended to protect patients (e.g., during surgery).\nNevertheless, high quality standard surgical masks (type II/IIR according to European Norm EN 14683) appear to be as effective as FFP2 masks in preventing droplet-associated viral infections of HCWs as reported from influenza or SARS.\nSo far, no head-to-head trials with these masks have been published for COVID-19.\nNeither mask type completely prevents transmission, which may be due to inappropriate handling and alternative transmission pathways.\nTherefore, compliance with a bundle of infection control measures including thorough hand hygiene is key.\nDuring high-risk procedures, both droplets and aerosols may be produced, reason why respirators are indicated for these interventions.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"NEI\", \"evidence\": []}", "id": 486}

Emory researchers want to see how far that resemblance extends.\n\nAbstract:\nThe novel coronavirus Covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses.\nInstead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury.\nMost noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups.\nChildren and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.\nPossible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against Covid-19.\nThe first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (\"Spanish flu\" 1918, \"Asian flu\" 1956 and \"the Hong Kong flu\" 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines.\nThe immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4 + memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response.\nAccording to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).\nThe CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting \"lung crash\" until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged.\nFinally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection.\nIn fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"NEI\", \"evidence\": []}", "id": 498}

More closely characterise the association between smoking and severe COVID-19 disease by assessing whether the association is modified by age (as a proxy of length of smoking), gender, ethnic group, and whether people have asthma or COPD.\n3. Assess for evidence of a dose-response relation between smoking intensity and disease severity, which would help create a case for causality.\n4.\nExamine the association between former smokers who are using NRT or are vaping and disease severity.\n5.

However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.\n\nAbstract:\nLittle information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus in animals is available to date.\nWhereas no one husbandry animal case has been reported to date, which would have significant implications in food safety, companion animals play a role in COVID-19 epidemiology that opens up new questions.\nThere is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect felines, dogs and minks, and there is evidence of human-to-animal infection.\nLikewise, the S protein nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated in domestic animals and humans is identical, and the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 in cats is efficient.\nBesides, the epidemiological evidence for this current pandemic indicates that the spillover to humans was associated with close contact between man and exotic animals, very probably in Chinese wet markets, thus there is a growing general consensus that the exotic animal markets, should be strictly regulated.\nThe examination of these findings and the particular role of animals in COVID-19 should be carefully analyzed in order to establish preparation and containment measures.\nAnimal management and epidemiological surveillance must be also considered for COVID-19 control, and it can open up new questions regarding COVID-19 epidemiology and the role that animals play in it.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect felines, dogs and minks, and there is evidence of human-to-animal infection.\", \"Likewise, the S protein nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated in domestic animals and humans is identical, and the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 in cats is efficient.\"]}", "id": 664}

Chen et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002294, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294) .\nIn this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses, including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses.\nBased on our current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV replicon models.\nInterestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of infection.\nTherefore, as a proof of principle, the current results indicate that coronavirus 2'-O-MTase activity can be targeted in vitro and in vivo.\nIMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic potential.\nSARS-CoV encodes the 2'-O-MTase that is composed of the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity.\nOur current results demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing inhibitory peptides.\nWe demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice.\nThis work makes it possible to develop broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10 2'-O-MTase of coronaviruses.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"SUPPORT\", \"evidence\": [\"We demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice.\"]}", "id": 803}

Decroly et al., J Virol 82:8071-8084, 2008, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00407-08; M. Bouvet et al., PLoS Pathog 6:e1000863, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863; E.

Chen et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002294, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294) .\nIn this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses, including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses.\nBased on our current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV replicon models.\nInterestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of infection.\nTherefore, as a proof of principle, the current results indicate that coronavirus 2'-O-MTase activity can be targeted in vitro and in vivo.\nIMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic potential.\nSARS-CoV encodes the 2'-O-MTase that is composed of the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity.\nOur current results demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing inhibitory peptides.\nWe demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice.\nThis work makes it possible to develop broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10 2'-O-MTase of coronaviruses.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"CONTRADICT\", \"evidence\": [\"We demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice.\"]}", "id": 846}

Chen et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002294, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294) .\nIn this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses, including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses.\nBased on our current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV replicon models.\nInterestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of infection.\nTherefore, as a proof of principle, the current results indicate that coronavirus 2'-O-MTase activity can be targeted in vitro and in vivo.\nIMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic potential.\nSARS-CoV encodes the 2'-O-MTase that is composed of the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity.\nOur current results demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing inhibitory peptides.\nWe demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice.\nThis work makes it possible to develop broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10 2'-O-MTase of coronaviruses.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"CONTRADICT\", \"evidence\": [\"We demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice.\"]}", "id": 861}

Clean and disinfect surfaces\n\nAbstract:\nSince December 2019, a respiratory pandemic named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm.\nThe symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure.\nTransmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission are also speculated.\nResearch is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease.\nIn such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics.\nUnani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment.\nIn Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs.\nDrugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc.\nare prescribed in various forms.\nScientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.", "answer": "{\"verdict\": \"NEI\", \"evidence\": []}", "id": 888}

More closely characterise the association between smoking and severe COVID-19 disease by assessing whether the association is modified by age (as a proxy of length of smoking), gender, ethnic group, and whether people have asthma or COPD.\n3.
