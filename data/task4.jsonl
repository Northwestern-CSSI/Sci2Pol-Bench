However, we find that the most ambitious proposals do come close to levels in a low-energy-demand scenario where CDR requirements are minimized, suggesting that if countries pledge more ambitious emissions reductions consistent with these scenarios, the CDR gap will be closed.\n    C.

If policymakers tax bioenergy according to these average expected emissions, that is, apply a similar carbon price to a litre of biofuels as to a litre of diesel, the total future bioenergy-induced emissions decrease, as the demand is reduced.\n    B.
