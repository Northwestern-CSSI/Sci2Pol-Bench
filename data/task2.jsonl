However, reaching an agreement so that a large coalition of countries proceeds jointly is challenging, leading to concerns that taking unilateral action might cause freeriding behaviour or carbon leakage. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Freeriding behaviour means other countries might diminish their efforts as another country has partly handled the problem.\nB. Carbon leakage implies that other countries might offset the lead country's efforts by increasing their emissions.\nC. When some, but not all, countries are willing to implement climate policy, a stalemate situation can occur, where no country acts.\nD.

In the first part, we empirically estimated the probability that a country would introduce carbon pricing depending on previous policies in other countries and the connections between countries regarding geographic proximity and shared membership in international organizations.\nB.

If bioenergy cultivation is not strictly limited to mar ginal or abandoned land, bioenergy may be grown on agricultural land and displace food production. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Shifting food production elsewhere can cause substantial carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions due to forest clearing in regions with weak or no land regulation.\nB. This puts policymakers in a difficult situation, because these indirect effects act via a globalized food market and thus are beyond the control of policies of individual nations.\nC. Because bioenergy and, in particular, modern biofuels are regarded as a valuable option to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels, it is thus important to understand if and potentially how locally implementable policies can contribute to reducing bioenergy-induced emissions.\nD. With an average emission factor (EF) of 92 kgCO2 GJ-1, we find that the production of modern biofuels, if averaged over a 30-year period, causes land-use-change emissions that are higher than those from burn ing fossil diesel (Fig. 1).\nE.

The main provider of flood insurance in the United States is the federally run National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a currently financially unsustainable insurance programme in substan tial debt.\nB. Moreover, the NFIP insufficiently incentivizes policyholders to undertake flood risk reduction measures to limit flood damages, because insurance premiums insufficiently reflect flood risk and do not reward risk reduction actions satisfactorily.\nC. To address these issues, the NFIP is underway with implementing the Risk Rating 2.0 program, which aims at better premium differentiation through risk-based pre miums and enhanced incentives for individual policyholder flood risk reduction.\nD. It is unknown whether these reforms are sufficient for future 'climate-proofing' of the NFIP or whether additional investments in flood protection are needed.\nE.

First, policies that aim to reduce health dispari ties by promoting access to higher education may not benefit the health of all population groups, such as mothers caring for dependent children. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Second, policies should reflect knowledge of the challenges faced by mothers pursuing postsec ondary college in ways that could help mothers experience more health returns to their degrees.\nB. Third, education policies that aim to improve population health may be most efficacious if they target adolescents and young adults and help them to transition from high school to postsecondary schooling and avoid interruptions to their education.\nC. Research suggests that higher education is associated with a range of positive health outcomes, from lower risk of mortality and fewer morbidities to less disability and better mental health.\nD. Yet little is known about these links when education is completed later in life when individuals have taken on additional responsibilities, such as becoming a parent.\nE.

Most existing research implicates provider gender bias and discrimination as the primary causes of these health care disparities; however, an exclusive focus on sexism at the interpersonal level does not consider the role of sociopolitical inequities that intersect with the health care system, such as gender inequities in pay, political representation, and employment. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Therefore, our research examines the role of state-level structural sexism, or gender inequity in power and resources across political, economic, and cultural domains, in shaping health care disparities between women and men in the United States.\nB. We linked state-level administrative data gauging gender disparities in pay, employment, poverty, political representation, and policy protec tions to individual-level data on health care availability, affordability, and quality from the Consumer Survey of Health Care Access.\nC. We then combined state-level measures into a single, multidimensional index of state-level sexism and used logistic regression analysis to test associa tions between state-level sexism and each indicator of health care access and quality.\nD. Higher state-level sexism is associated with higher inability to access care and more barriers to affording care for women but not for men (Figure 1).\nE.
