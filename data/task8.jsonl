Our study is among the first to investigate citizens' views on the second part of this equation. Using a large-scale survey, we assessed German voters' preferences for different policy design options to phase out coal. We found that the average respondent consistently prefers a more ambitious timeline. All else being equal, the preference was to phase out coal by 2025, which contrasts with the Coal Commission's proposal to phase out coal by 2038. A particular strength of our methodological approach is that the choice experiments allow us to scrutinize respondents' timing preferences in relation to possible trade-offs between the different attributes of an accelerated phase-out, such as higher cost. By comparing preferences across attributes, we find that support for an accelerated phase-out is upheld up to an additional cost to society of \u20ac8.5 billion (see Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 4}

Climate-tech investment has matured from Cleantech 1.0 to Cleantech 2.0, potentially leading to different investment effects across time periods (Supplementary Note 1)2,30. To assess potential differences, we replicate the analysis in Table 2 for both time periods. Whereas there is little difference in trends for exits, corporations are significantly associated with failure only in the Cleantech 1.0 period (Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). Further investigation is needed to determine the causes of this change (Discussion); however, it may indicate a lower hazard of startup failure from future corporate investments. All other trends remain the same, indicating the analysis presented here is robust to temporal differences. We also examine if our results vary for a subset of high-patenting startups, which may indicate 'unicorn' startups that potentially skew our results (Supplementary Note 2). We find that no investment source is a significant predictor of exits or failures for high-patenting startups, but location in a climate-tech hotspot is highly significant and correlates with an increase in likelihood of exit (Supplementary Table 15). Corporate investment shows a unique relationship for these high-patenting startups with a negative but insignificant correlation with failure, contrasted with other private investment, which still has a positive and significant correlation with failure as in the overall dataset (Supplementary Table 16).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 7}

First, Model 1 shows that increases in income inequality are associated with decreases in life expectancy (b = -.031; p < .001) when nonlagged, while Model 4 shows this association for lagged income inequality is not statistically significant (b = -.007; p = .347). The former association corresponded with a standard deviation increase in income inequality being associated with a .15-year decrease in life expectancy. This estimate was found by standardizing our income inequality measure and rerunning Model 1 (not shown). Second, both the nonlagged policy liberalism score (Model 2, b = 2.164, p = .07) and the lagged score (Model 5, b = 2.143, p < .05) are associated with life expectancy, net of income inequality. Third, the association between income inequality and life expectancy did not show any meaningful change with the inclusion of policy liberalism in either the lagged or nonlagged models. This latter point hints that the association between income inequality and life expectancy is not mediated by policy liberalism.

The highest economic growth for each of the three countries is projected under SSP5, whereas the lowest economic growth occurs under SSP3. Cooperative adaptive management policy for the GERD We use the Nile adaptive management framework to formulate and design an adaptive management policy for the GERD's initial filling and long-term operation for 2020-2045, involving short-term rules and interim and long-term adaptation measures to cope with climate change uncertainties. The formulation is based on cooperative behaviour whereby the riparian countries consider each other's interests through adaptive measures. The formulation of the GERD adaptive filling and operation policy is described briefly below and detailed in Extended Data Fig. 5. In the adaptive formulation, water retention during the GERD's initial filling phase is carried out in July and August and follows a stage-based approach (Supplementary Table 2) while maintaining a minimum outflow of 1.28 bcm per month, similar to the Washington draft proposal19. From March to June, additional interim water releases during the initial filling phase are made if the storage of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) reservoir in Egypt falls below 60 bcm. This would enable quick initial filling of the GERD, as data show consistently high water storage in the HAD reservoir in recent years (2020-2022)47.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 12}

During the war, controls create a lack of capacity, as indicated by chronic shortages in drilled wells and transportation facilities8,9. When controls are lifted, price increases are suppressed by non-market interventions. For example, Standard Oil of Indiana and Phillips Petroleum Company ration gasoline to dealers in June 1947 (ref. 10).

This is twice as much as the cost of excluding solar power and similar to the cost of excluding wind power, despite both of them cost optimally providing more primary energy (Fig. 2d,e). Excluding any of these primary energy sources thus leads to much higher costs. Wind and solar power are more readily interchangeable whereas the substitution of biomass is much more expensive because biomass provides non-fossil carbon in addition to energy, for which the substitute, DAC, coupled with a necessary expansion of additional energy provision, ends up much more expensive.

As lower- and middle-income countries get wealthier, they increasingly demand more energy services for appliances, heating and cooling to support their improved living standards. At the same time, the use of traditional fuels, which are still commonly used for cooking in certain areas (predominantly in Africa), decreases substantially until 2050. Energy demand reductions also occur in OECD countries, where use of natural gas for space heating is steadily decreasing due to improved insulation levels under current policies. In transport, per capita energy demand reduces in some regions, despite rising demand for mobility, due to increased use of electric vehicles with much higher efficiency56 than internal combustion engine vehicles. In contrast to the global results, some models signal that emissions from buildings could be higher in ACT and TEC (Supplementary Fig. 22), probably due to rebound effects. This is particularly noticeable in India, other Asian and Africa and Middle East. An increase is also observed in transport emissions by COFFEE and WITCH for the United States (ACT) and European Union (TEC), respectively. Carefully adapted rebound mitigation policies, for example, through carbon pricing or providing consumption information, could in such cases further increase the effectiveness of demand-side measures57,58.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 15}

We found substantial levels of residual emissions at net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, on average 18% of current emissions for Annex I countries. The majority of strategies were imprecise about which sectors residual emissions would originate from, and few offered specific projections of how residual emissions could be balanced by carbon removal. Our findings indicate the need for a consistent definition of residual emissions, as well as processes that standardize and compare expectations about residual emissions across countries. This is necessary for two reasons: to avoid projections of excessive residuals and correspondent unsustainable or unfeasible carbon-removal levels and to send clearer signals about the temporality of fossil fuel use.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 16}

They are broader than researchers' implicit understandings of health when operationalizing health lifestyles. Health lifestyles encompass children's behaviors (including traditional health behaviors and others linked to wider conceptualizations of health, such as socializing and doing homework). Although content likely varies, norms in the communities that we studied prescribe that children's health lifestyles must reflect substantial parental identity investments and coherent parenting narratives articulating the lifestyle's benefits for health, well-being, and future success. Children's identity expression is also dictated by community norms. Health lifestyles create advantages for children while simultaneously reaffirming parents' advantaged class standing.

In other words, despite the subnational heterogeneity in policy stringency, energy markets are tightly coupled across states, allowing much of the heterogeneity in policy to be arbitraged through trade activities in the energy markets. Comparing the Heterogeneous and Hybrid approach with the Uniform approach, many states adjust the amount of electricity production, technology choices and trading volume with neighbouring states. Nationally, to achieve an 80% cut in GHG emissions, we find ~10% more inter-grid electricity trade under the heterogeneous policy approach than the uniform approach (see Extended Data Fig. 2 for net electricity trade across 15 grid regions; Supplementary Fig. 5 shows a map of the grid regions). There is also a shift in the geographic pattern of where critical mitigation technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), are being deployed (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6). This is because, with a heterogeneous approach, the mitigation efforts are shifted from low- to high-supporting states, pushing the green states to achieve deep cuts in their emissions by turning to negative emissions technologies such as BECCS.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 21}

Segmentation studies have been used to identify different types of consumer in relation to household electricity storage50, acceptance of demand control51, energy conservation behaviours52 or acceptance of smart grids. Some studies have used measured or metred consumption data combined with only basic household and building characteristics to identify groups of energy-consuming households53. Others have used a richer suite of variables, based on qualitative surveys and constructs from behavioural psychology, to capture the psychosocial antecedents of likely market acceptance and targets for behaviour change52. The bases used to cluster the sample populations in these studies were multifarious, ranging among general values, lifestyles, general patterns of energy-consuming behaviours, attitudes to environmental issues and specific energy-related behaviours. Some focused the clustering on the antecedents of behaviour only43, whereas others mixed both the antecedents and the intentions or behaviours themselves52, as we have done here.The cluster analysis identified four groups individually representing between 16 and 35% of the sample. The groups were profiled using the variables used to create them as well as other factors, such as demographic characteristics and current energy use. Profiling consisted of characterizing each segment individually using descriptive statistics as well as comparisons with the other segments using measures of variance and association.

CapEx depends heavily on the price of hardware, which accounts for the majority of the total installed cost, with construction labour being the second-largest contributor. CapEx represents about 50% of the LCOE in the baseline model, with operation and maintenance (O&M) and financing costs representing the balance. The baseline financial model assumes a debt fraction of 60% with an interest rate of 5% and a return on equity of 10%, for a total weighted average cost of capital of 7%. The CapEx includes a profit margin for the project developer, while the construction contractor's profit is implicitly included in the contractor markup. The LCOE represents the cost to the project developer of building and operating the system, and of satisfying the debt and equity financers of the project with their required returns, and hence represents a minimum sustainable price for the sale of electricity.

These prior works are either too general (national-level and average consumption figures) or need to be complemented with other data sources on consumption.

Space is, of course, a well-known reason given that most repowering projects are developed from existing wind farm sites. This category generally corresponds to what is typically captured by analyses using an on-site approach.The second major individual reason for dismantling turbines  in repowering is a violation of the cumulative noise emissions, which comprises 13% of the total number of turbines and 8%  of the full capacity dismantled. Hence, noise regulation in Denmark has a considerable impact on repowering projects. This impact was also underlined by several of the interviewees. Here, it is relevant to note that noise regulation differs from country to country.

Second, when using these estimates to benchmark the sensitivity to an increasing domestic cost path, the effect of switching from a constant to an increasing schedule was similar to doubling the average monthly household costs from 0.5% of GDP (\u20ac28, \u20ac39, \u00a315 and $53) to 1.0% of GDP (\u20ac56, \u20ac77, \u00a330 and $107).

For the interpretation of our results, we point to the ex-post nature of our investigation: each of the tariff scenarios sends a specific signal to households, for example, pa100 and pm100 provide incentives for avoiding peak loads while they do not penalize high electricity consumption. Ideally, households would analyse their consumption patterns with respect to the applied tariff scheme and adapt their behaviour to minimize costs under certain boundary conditions41,42. As the data exploited in our study were already collected in 20102011, households were not provided with such signals. Figure 1 shows box plots of the change (in %) of the annual network expenditures under the 11 tariff scenarios compared with the reference scenario for the 765 households (for analysis of the subsample see Supplementary Fig. 1). Several outcomes are evident: first, the most significant change in households' network expenditures are calculated for scenarios with a dominant share of fixed or peak-load charges and thereby deviate significantly from the reference scenario. The interpretation works vice versa, that is, one would observe similar changes in household network costs if, say, f100 was currently applied and was substituted for the reference scenario.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 32}

Non-CO2 s respond to climate policy in two ways33. First, fuel switching and associated phasing out of carbon-intensive fuels due to climate policy reduce associated non-CO2 emissions (for example, fugitive methane emissions from resource production). Thus, higher CO2 ambition implies higher non-CO2 ambition. Second, non-CO2 emissions that are largely unaffected by fuel switching such as hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions from cooling energy use and industrial process emissions (perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride) respond to climate policy through the implementation of additional control measures. In our analysis, the NDC+ and NDC++ pathways result, respectively, in 18% and 24% reduction in methane emissions from the energy system in 2030 relative to 2020. In terms of total methane emissions from energy and agricultural systems, the reduction is, respectively, 4% and 8%. In comparison, over a hundred countries made a commitment under the Global Methane Pledge\u2014a key outcome of COP26\u2014to collectively reduce methane emissions by at least 30% (ref. 34).

Notably, most of the carbon footprint increase comes from relaxing fertility policies (increasing total (per capita) carbon footprint by 21-35% (8-12%) for 2060),  while delaying retirement policy has far smaller impacts (by only 2-3% (2-3%)). The fertility policies in combination with retirement delay are projected to have greater impacts on those provinces with a higher Theil index, which is similar to the impacts of fertility policy alone (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, when focusing only on the impact of the retirement delay policy, we found that the impact tends to be greater in provinces with large discrepancies in per capita carbon footprints between middle-aged and older people (Supplementary Fig. 4). For example, in Inner Mongolia, which has the highest discrepancies in per capita carbon footprints between middle-aged and older people, the retirement delay policy is projected to increase its average per capita carbon footprint by approximately 5% (Fig. 3, Inner Mongolia). By comparison, in Yunnan, which has the lowest discrepancies in per capita carbon footprints between these two age groups, the retirement delay policy is projected to increase its average per capita carbon footprint by less than 0.10% (Fig. 3, Yunnan).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 35}

We find that\u2014 irrespective of the policy design\u2014a large fraction of LUC emissions does not originate from the sites of bioenergy cultivation but occurs indirectly at formerly forested areas or pasture, where agricultural activity displaced by bioenergy production is moved (Fig. 2). Those ILUC emissions as well as bioenergy plantations directly replacing carbon-rich ecosystems contribute to high EFs (for example, in the northern regions of South America for noLUreg; Fig. 2a,c,d). Without LU policies globally, more than 85% of the additional emissions induced by bioenergy production originate from territories that together generate less than 16% of total biomass production (the red and dark red wedges in Fig. 2b). By contrast, the main part of the bioenergy (more than three quarters across all policy settings) is being produced with a direct 80-year EF of less than 37 kg CO2 GJbiofuel -1 (half the EF of diesel; the blue wedges in Fig. 2), directly causing less than 10% of the total bioenergy-induced emissions if LU regulation policies are absent. Therefore, by only accounting for direct LUC emissions within major bioenergy-producing regions, only a small fraction of attached emissions can be traced. Accordingly, the total ILUC emissions related to the total bioenergy production are considerable and vary strongly with the regulatory framework.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 40}

Table 1 shows a shift in both community distrust and subjective social isolation toward greater distrust and isolation. Generalized trust appeared relatively stable, however, which reflects the importance of considering trust in specific targets with whom an individual may interact rather than more diffuse perceptions of trust. Table 1 also shows that mean levels of psychological distress increased between the two waves. Although the difference in distress is not statistically significant, ancillary analyses showed that the lack of statistical significance was largely due to small compositional differences between the two surveys. For example, simply controlling for compositional differences in age and presence of children led to an estimation of significant greater distress in March compared to September. We therefore turn to the multivariate analyses that examine differences between the two waves of surveys when taking these compositional factors into account.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 41}

For the timing attribute, we take 2040 as the reference category, as this level most closely matches the 2038 timeline ultimately recommended by the Coal Commission. We find that policy scenarios with 2025 as an end date have a significantly higher probability of being supported than policies with later end dates. Postponing the phase-out to 2040 leads to a decrease in policy support of 10.7 percentage points, and postponing it to 2100\u2014as reflected in the G7's statement to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century\u2014leads to a decrease in policy support of 15.3 percentage points, compared with the 2040 baseline. As is apparent in the data, Germans are also sensitive to the cost of a coal phase-out. Every increase in annual cost of \u20ac10 per household (or about \u20ac400 million per year for the German economy as a whole) decreases public support by about seven percentage points. With regard to employment effects, people prefer scenarios with lower job losses over scenarios with higher job losses, but they value newly created jobs slightly higher than lost old jobs. For instance, while the scenario with 20,000 lost jobs decreases phase-out support by 9.2 percentage points compared with a scenario with only 5,000 lost jobs, creating the same number of new jobs increases phase-out support by 12.2 percentage points. The type of supportive measures for the local economy is the least important of the five attributes. Among the design options offered here, the preferred attribute level is an expansion of renewable energies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 43}

Women with stable job, traditional family or entrepreneur familist trajectories have a lower risk of depression. By contrast, careerist, late union individuals have a relatively higher prevalence in the high-risk depression group. The risk of depression correlates with lower defamilization, with women at higher risk having experienced significantly lower levels of defamilization. Typically, women at higher risk of depression are older, have lower education and income, come from lower childhood SES, and rate their current and childhood health as poor, with a higher prevalence of pre-50 illness. Notably, they drink less, but this finding reverses and loses significance in the multivariate analysis. To better understand these associations, I conducted a logistic regression to predict the post-50 likelihood of reporting a high risk of depression considering work/family trajectories, birth cohort, defamilization, and other covariates. The analysis includes interactions between trajectories, cohorts, and defamilization.

Specifically, for Black and Latino clustering, these scores are significant and negative, meaning that as the clustering of these two groups increases, the number of vaccine sites per 100,000 people decreases. Essentially, the higher the concentration and clustering of these two groups, the lower the  number of vaccine sites. These effect sizes are also large. We discuss these coefficients in terms of standard deviation changes because the scale of each variable is so different, although the original coefficients are available in the tables. In the case of Black clustering, a 1 SD (648.99) increase in Black clustering relates to 3.47 decrease in the number of vaccine sites per 100,000 people. Given that the average number of sites per 100,000 people is only 7.92, this is a notable change. For Latino clustering, a 1 SD (1,611.93) increase in Latino clustering is related to a 1.59 decrease in the number of vaccine sites per 100,000 people. These are both sizable coefficients and indicate that Black- and Latino-clustered areas are less likely to have vaccine sites.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 52}

The corporate tax cut has reduced production distortions, reallocated production to the regions with high marginal labor products and improved global economic efficiency, which brought real income gains. Meanwhile, the global corporate tax cut raised global carbon emissions, negatively impacting national welfare.

Blue Hg stock is therefore an important, dynamic, reactive but overlooked Hg pool in the global Hg cycle and health risk. Blue C ecosystems can provide a range of ecosystem services such as protecting biodiversity and fisheries and increasing water quality. However, the co-accumulation and contrary ecological effects of OC and Hg in coastal ecosystems indicate that expanding Blue C ecosystems are very likely to add to the Blue Hg stock, consequently resulting in an increase of Hg risk in global coastal seas (Fig. 2). Delay and failure to implement the Blue C strategies may well accelerate the impending climate catastrophe and other coastal and ecological disasters, inevitably resulting in substantial economic, ecological and human losses3. We refer to increased Blue Hg stocks and the risk caused by expanding Blue C ecosystems to mitigate climate change and achieve co-benefits as the 'Blue Hg dilemma'. The close interactions between C and Hg in coastal ecosystems point to the importance of a holistic understanding of the benefits, risks and trade-offs of Blue C sequestration strategies. We highlight that the Blue Hg dilemma should be accounted for in future Blue C strategy assessments to inform policymakers and help them design better management and restoration policies across sectors and actors that can balance economic, ecological, climatic and health interests for future generations, particularly in the context of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 54}

A core part of central bank re-risking  is supervisory, that is, understanding the magnitude of these risks and incorporating them into financial risk management practices, such as stress tests. It follows that if a country is highly exposed to physical climate risks, it would adopt these practices. In fact, prior research has demonstrated a correlation between physical risks and central bank management of climate risks18. We measure climate hazard exposure by using the exposure component of the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-Gain) country index.We do not find an association between exposure to climate hazards and re-risking. Instead, we find that de-risking is positively and significantly correlated with higher exposure to physical climate risks. This is puzzling and requires further analysis. One would expect that central banks of economies with high exposure to climate hazards engage primarily in re-risking. To illustrate cross-national variation, we plot the ND-Gain exposure index (our measure for physical climate risk) against de-risking scores in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 62}

During the other 184 quarters, the price implied by the cointegrating relation is altered by regimes (Table 2). Most regimes occur after OPEC gains control over the marginal supply of crude oil in the early 1970s (Regime 2).

The lack of a significant relation does not indicate that OPEC is unimportant. Rather, the lack of a relation may be caused by changes in OPEC behaviour, such as a change from acting as the marginal supplier to defending a fair share of the market (and vice versa). Such changes alter the relation between UtilOPEC and Price; the relation would be positive when OPEC acts as the marginal supplier and negative when OPEC acts to defend a fair share of the market. Such changes in sign prevent the statistical methodology from quantifying a coefficient for UtilOPEC that applies over the entire sample period.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 63}

This observation is particularly important because, as discussed above, the options contract is designed to have the same financial impact as the capacity markets currently utilized or under discussion in many real-world markets. A hint as to the mechanism at work is provided by the trades made in the Both Contracts case. The peaker technology prefers to sell options, selling 78.4 GW of options contracts against only 1.2 GW of futures. The baseload technology exhibits the opposite preference, selling 80.7 GW of futures but no options. Tables 2 and 3 show the reason for these trading preferences. Table 2 shows the payouts for the futures contract in the Both Contracts case. The 50 bold cells in the table represent the worst-case realizations of demand and fuel cost for the baseload technology in the No Trading case. As alpha = 0.5 in this example, these 50 scenarios are the worst-case scenarios identified by the CVaR calculation for the baseload investors. Analogously, Table 3 shows the payouts for the option contract in the Both Contracts case along with the worst-case combinations of demand and fuel costs for the peaker technology. The difference in the bold cells between the two tables reflects the risk exposure of the two technologies: although investors in the peaking technology are only concerned about lower-than-expected demand, investors in the baseload technology are concerned about both lower-than-expected demand and lower-than-expected fuel cost. As we discuss in Methods section, employing CVaR is equivalent to modifying the nominal probability distribution under a risk-neutral objective function. In this numerical example, the modified probability mass function for each agent corresponds to placing probability 3 200 I on the bold scenarios and 1 200 I on the regular scenarios in the respective tables (in place of the nominal 1 100 I on all scenarios).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 65}

First, a causal interpretation of our results assumes there were no other events occurring at or around the passing of these laws in each state that affected perinatal outcomes for Mexican/ Central American-born birthing people living in the state. To test this possibility, we used a placebo approach and examined the effect of passage of a driver's license law on U.S.-born, non-Hispanic White birthing people (see Table S2 in the online version of the article), a group for whom no effect from the law was expected. In the fully adjusted model, there was no observed association for low birthweight, mean birthweight, or entry into prenatal care and a slight inverse association for preterm birth (RR = .97; 95% CI = [.96, .98]). Second, we fit models stratifying by birthing person's educational attainment (Table S3 in the online version of the article). In fully adjusted models, we observed a slightly stronger protective association among individuals who did not have a high school education for preterm birth, low birthweight, and mean birthweight. However, the observed association with first-trimester entry into prenatal care remained in the opposite direction of our hypothesis (lower probability of entry for individuals exposed to the law since conception). Lastly, to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our results, we repeated our analysis excluding births in 2020 to 2021 (Table S4 in the online version of the article). \n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 67}

We find that a standard deviation (s.d.) increase in distributor (up-front) price reduces normalized monthly sales by 0.27 s.d. We also see a comparable effect of seasonal factors in explaining the variation in refill sales. A shift from 'no cropping' season to cropping or harvest season increases monthly refill sales by 0.22 or 0.26 s.d. respectively, everything else remaining equal. Refill rates in summer, when agricultural activity is limited, are ~10% lower than rates during cropping and harvest seasons when people are busy with agricultural work. During the cropping season, people are busy preparing fields, planting and weeding. They place a high value on their time and meals tend to be quick, which is conducive to cooking with LPG. Later, during the harvest season, people have cash in hand, making LPG purchases easier33. In contrast, during the summer, people have more time and less income. The climate is hot and dry, so people have easy access to dry biomass as well as crop residues from after the  harvest period. During the cropping season, which coincides with the monsoon, wood is wet and crop residues have been consumed34. Notably, there are three active distributors in Koppal and the regression results indicate that customers procuring from one distributor purchase fewer cylinders than those procuring LPG from the other two, other predictors remaining constant. On the basis of several interviews, we found that the worst performing distributor (D3) provides home delivery to all villages in its coverage area, while the other two do not, which appears counter-intuitive as home delivery should facilitate purchases23,28. Whether the comparatively higher normalized  monthly sales for D1 and D2 is due to greater sales acumen of the distributors or better socio-economic/behavioural perspectives of the consumers under the catchment area of these distributors cannot be determined, given the limitations of the data.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 69}

To explore this further, we sort oil fields according to the characteristic directly targeted by each policy. Specifically, these characteristics, shown on the x axis across the columns of Fig. 4, include an oil-field cluster's: (1) area share near sensitive sites, (2) per barrel cost of extraction per barrel and (3) GHG emissions intensity per barrel. These characteristics are directly affected by a setback, an excise tax and a carbon tax. Under each policy, oil fields on the left of the x axis retire first, moving rightward as stringency tightens. For example, for a particular setback distance (2,500 feet in Fig. 4a,d), fields with a greater share of their area near sensitive sites will experience greater reduction in oil production than fields with areas less affected by the same setback. The latter fields that  are farther from sensitive sites will be increasingly affected as setback distances increase. Likewise, under a low excise tax, the oil fields that initially phase out production are those with higher extraction costs. As the excise tax increases, oil fields with lower extraction costs incrementally phase out production. A similar pattern holds for carbon taxes and their effect on oil fields with varying GHG intensities.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 70}

Moving from an increasing to a constant cost path caused a  significant increase in policy support by 7 percentage points compared to the widely discussed option of ramping up costs over time (the reference category), even when we explicitly specified and fixed the cost level of the policy proposal. At the same time, decreasing cost schedules also raised climate policy support compared to the increasing cost path. The causal effects estimated from the conjoint analysis show how cost paths changed the average level of support, but may as such not be informative about the level of support for a particular policy package, which was 50% across all profiles by design in the forced-choice, paired-profile conjoint experiment. We also note that the causal effect estimates are a function of both the preference for a policy feature and the intensity of that preference, which contrasts to the analysis above in which the estimates are simply a function of the number of individuals who prefer a given cost schedule (Fig. 2). Understanding the rationale for the positive estimate of the decreasing cost path in the conjoint experiment seems a productive inquiry for future research, but we focus primarily on the comparison between constant costs and increasing costs in the remainder of this paper because constant costs are preferred to an increasing time path across both measurement strategies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 71}

As discussed earlier, setbacks applied to only new wells result in a continuous decline in oil production and GHG emissions (Fig. 6). In contrast, setbacks applied to all wells induce an immediate drop in statewide oil production and associated GHG emissions in 2020 as existing wells within the setback distance fall out of production. This drop is then followed by a gradual decline thereafter that tracks the BAU trajectory. Oil production and GHG emissions reductions increase as setbacks get longer. Although a 1-mile setback, the largest considered in this study, applied to all wells achieves a substantially greater GHG emissions reduction (81%) by 2045 compared with the same setback on new wells (72%), it still falls short of meeting the 90% reduction target (Fig. 6b). However, the cumulative GHG emissions reduction over 2020-2045 for the 1-mile setback applied to all wells is on par with those of excise and carbon taxes that result in a 90% annual GHG emissions reduction in 2045 (Fig. 2c).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 72}

In years with high demand and low wind and hydraulic reserves, for example, increases in the price of natural gas would lead to a more intense reaction in electricity prices than in opposite conditions. Interesting insights can be obtained by comparing the value of this sensitivity between two pre-defined scenarios (for example, a high wind and rain year versus a low wind and rain year). Our interest, however, is to provide a measure of the sensitivity of electricity prices to gas prices across the stochastic range of possible scenarios. For this, we define the \u03b2-sensitivity metric as the projected change in the annual average electricity price when the annual average price of natural gas increases by 1 euro. \u03b2-sensitivity is derived from the linear regression of the average annual price on the price of gas and other control variables across all Monte Carlo simulations (Methods and Supplementary Section 5 provide further details on the rationale and estimation of \u03b2-sensitivity).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 74}

To demonstrate this, the 'no damages' scenario depicts the optimal carbon tax with revenue recycling but where climate damages are artificially set to zero regardless of warming (Fig. 5, black line). In this case, the only benefit of a carbon tax is the redistribution it allows. Global decarbonization that is optimal purely from this motive is substantial and ranges between ~50 and 60%, as this ensures maximum redistribution to the poor. Still, this is much lower than the case where climate benefits exist Nature Climate ChaNge alongside redistributional benefits, demonstrating that substantial incentive to decarbonize further remains even at such high levels of decarbonization. An equal per capita global redistribution leads to similar decarbonization trajectories to those reported in Fig. 5 (which assume within-region redistribution only), a result driven largely by the carbon Laffer curve (Supplementary Fig. 5).

This highlights an important caveat to our storyline: the positive effect of the carbon tax through progressive redistribution is initially strong but diminishes once the economy decarbonizes enough for revenues to decline. In short, there is a 'carbon Laffer curve'. Conceptually, the Laffer curve is the widely recognized fact that tax revenue does not monotonically increase with the tax rate\u2014in the case of sufficiently large taxes, market transactions  (for example, fossil fuel use) reduce to the point where there is little taxable activity to generate revenue33. As a quantitative illustration of the carbon Laffer curve in NICE, Fig. 4 shows this nonlinear relationship between global near-term (2025) decarbonization  and tax revenue. Total revenue is highest in the 55-75% decarbonization range and decreases thereafter until full decarbonization ultimately implies that no revenue is generated (under full decarbonization there are no industrial emission to be taxed).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 77}

For all three policy approaches, we find much higher mitigation costs under: (a) limited electricity infrastructure investment and production, (b) no investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and (c) limited availability of biomass. The greatest impacts on mitigation costs come from constraining CCS and biomass because this restricts the role of BECCS and forces greater reliance upon extremely expensive technologies outside the electricity and refinery sectors (cf. Extended Data Fig. 6 with Fig. 4), such as hydrogen use in transport and industrial sectors. Relaxing the biomass constraint, by contrast, significantly lowers the mitigation costs (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12). Limiting electricity production has a lesser impact on overall costs because, in the face of such constraints, reductions in energy demand through efficiency measures, increases in natural gas use coupled with CCS, as well as more mitigation in the refinery sector through BECCS, can provide additional decarbonization. Detailed discussions are included in Supplementary Note 3. Although these technology constraints raise the total national cost of mitigation, our main finding remains robust: a heterogeneous policy approach, relative to a uniform approach, is only slightly  more expensive.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 82}

Model 1 presents the estimates of the association between incarceration exposure and the speed of aging net of the full array of confounds. The results show that incarceration is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in this African American sample, with exposure predicting a greater accelerated aging score by about 2 years (b = 1.970; p \u2264 .001). After applying IPTW (Model 2) to the model, the association between incarceration exposure and the speed of aging is slightly reduced but remains statistically significant. Exposure to incarceration is associated with a 1.719 difference (approximately 1 year and 9 months) in accelerated aging (p \u2264 .001). This finding is illustrated in  Figure 1\u2014formerly incarcerated individuals are roughly 11 months (12 x .902) older biologically than expected based on their chronological (or calendar) age, whereas those who have never been incarcerated are 10 months younger biologically (12 x -.816) than expected based on their chronological age. In Model 3, we restricted the sample to respondents with propensity scores that fall within the range of propensities calculated for both the incarcerated and never incarcerated respondents. Similarly, in Model 4, we exclude all respondents with atypical propensities\u2014 propensity scores within the fifth percentiles. Both models reveal a stronger association between incarceration exposure and the speed of Grim aging, indicating a conservative estimate in Model 2.3 Together, the evidence from Table 2 indicates that among the African American respondents in our sample, incarceration exposure is associated with an acceleration in biological aging by 21 to 28 months.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 83}

Given the average energy savings attributed to audits from the Bayesian model discussed above, combined with building fuel mix and energy cost estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency49, we find that the average annual energy cost savings due to auditing for the NYC building stock are $0.121 ft-2 for office and $0.038 ft-2 for residential buildings.

We complemented it with an estimation of the heterogeneous impact of the primes by the number of thumbs up that customers receive (equation (3) in Methods). We obtained similar results: although the descriptive prime does not influence consumption on average (coefficient = 0.088, s.e. = 0.149, P = 0.554; Table 3, column 1), it led to a negative and statistically significant decrease in consumption among customers who received three thumbs up (coefficient = -0.959, s.e. = 0.284, P < 0.001; Table 3, column 4). This negative effect was persistent over 6, 12 and 18 months (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 14). Interestingly, the effect of the descriptive prime on the entire group of customers who received three thumbs up is smaller than the RD estimates for the three versus two thumbs-up threshold combined with the descriptive prime. Although these simple heterogeneity results should be taken with caution, as thumbs up are correlated with customers' characteristics (Supplementary Table 10), they can be interpreted in light of our conceptual framework and suggest a potential determinant of the strength of descriptive information. The sample of customers who received three thumbs up includes the most efficient users, who are far from the three versus two thumbs-up threshold. The further customers are from the threshold, the larger the deviation between their own consumption and the average electricity use, and therefore, we argue, the larger the strength of the descriptive norm contained in the standard eHER. In other words, we suggest that in our setting conformity motives become more influential the further away individuals are from the descriptive norm.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 98}

However, prior studies do not demonstrate any consistent technological shift. In energy-only markets, peaking units face substantial risk due to their dependence on the occurrence of high prices in a small number of hours. At the same time, several authors emphasized the natural hedge enjoyed by gas generators, which often set the price of electricity13-16. The ability to trade risk is a key element of this discussion. With complete risk trading, along with the standard assumptions of competitive markets, an equilibrium would achieve the (risk-aware) social optimum17-20. The connection between equilibrium and optimum implies that the impact of risk aversion on the generation mix can be in any direction depending on the types of risk that most concern market participants. This theoretical result, however, depends on the presence of 'complete' markets, which include a security that corresponds to every possible future state of the world. In this context, our focus is less on incompleteness than on asymmetry: the introduction of a capacity market amounts to a trade against a subset of future world states that peaking plants are particularly concerned about. In the PJM interconnection (PJM), for example, a unit with a marginal cost of US$10 MWh-1 could expect to earn 17% of its operating profits from the capacity market, whereas a unit with a US$100 MWh-1 marginal cost could expect 90% (Supplementary Note 2). Along these lines, our results suggest a different interpretation of the natural hedge of gas. By itself, the hedge does not confer an advantage. It is only when combined with a capacity mechanism, which removes risk related to the frequency of scarcity events, that the hedge becomes an advantage.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 99}

Under the COVID scenario, we observe a much larger share of solid fuels, and higher total cooking energy demand because of the inefficiency of these fuels. This large COVID effect could result in an increase in biomass use until 2030, with a light rebound in 2040, when income levels are assumed to go back to the reference SSP3 trend. Climate mitigation policies could attenuate the transition away from polluting stoves by making oil and gas-based fuels more expensive.

Thus, CBRS areas tend to attract more affluent residents and have become less affordable for renters. Indeed, the CBRA raises the barrier to entry in designated areas by, for example, necessitating self-insurance against floods31,32.

This ratio changed over time. From 2000 to 2015, we found an average of just 0.024 new fixity reforms per country year. From 2016 to 2023, however, they occurred at a rate of 0.13 new reforms per country year, a fivefold increase. Fixity reforms accounted for most of the overall rise in the frequency of reforms after Paris. The advantages of fixity reforms are self-evident: floating prices are not automatically eroded by inflation, currency depreciation or global oil shocks. In theory, fixity reforms should be more durable than price reforms. In practice, governments found it politically difficult to allow prices to float, especially when world oil prices rose too far. As a result, fixity reforms were no more durable than price reforms. While fixity reforms were more likely than price reforms to survive in their first year, they were less likely to survive after 12 months. The mean duration of price reforms was 1.8 years, while the mean duration of fixity reforms was 1.5 years. By December 2023, when our data end, three countries still had floating prices in place: Myanmar, which is the poorest country in our sample; United Arab Emirates, which is the second wealthiest; and Nigeria, which falls near the middle.

The average increase was 17 kWh across all houses in this climate zone.

Additionally, simulatedresults show that runoff from the surrounding land areas (where rainfall occurs) can flow along roadways into the Warren area, leading to alocalized pluvial flooding (denoted by FC2 in Fig. 1). A third likely causeidentified is related to backwater surcharge through the stormwaterpipe network and the catch basins in source areas. Specifically, extremewater levels within open channels induce backwater flow at stormwateroutfalls, causing a substantial surge of reverse flow into topographicallyupstream source areas of the drainage system, leading to surcharge atmanholes and flooding in areas that did not experience rainfall.

Our results indicate that, ceteris paribus, households with higher income are better off when tariffs charging for measured peak demand are introduced. Among others, ref. 44 showed that photovoltaic panels in combination with home storage appliances reduce the peak loads of households significantly, while at the same time also reduce the volumes of electricity purchased via the grid. Higher-income households are likely to install photovoltaic panels and related peak-load-reducing equipment at higher rates than lower-income households45,46.

In total, we estimate that eight other severe power deficit events would have occurred in the current system if it had existed from 1950 to 2021, assuming the climate conditions of 1950-2021 (Fig. 2). The second largest power deficit event at 1.26 TWh is predicted when using  climate data from 1983, assuming installed generation capacities as in February 2021. Furthermore, we observe 17 minor events. However, as the sum of the deficits of all 17 minor events is less than 1% of the sum of the deficits of the nine largest events, we exclude them from further analysis.In our model simulations, the loss-of-load event has a duration of 106 hours and causes an aggregated deficit of 1.49 TWh, at a peak capacity deficit of 31.3 GW. There are several events with similar peak capacity deficits identified in the 1950-2021 period, and also events with a comparably long duration, but none with a comparably high amount of loss of load. In the largest events before 2021 (1962 and 1983), 250 GWh less lost load results from our simulation (Fig. 2).

We found that a large fraction of  biomass is used in combination with CCS (58-95% in 2100), particularly when total production is reduced by a bioenergy tax (Extended Data Fig. 6). In the absence of comprehensive LU sector emission regulations, however, a large fraction of carbon dioxide removals (CDR) from BECCS is used to compensate the additional LUC emissions (Fig. 3b). Without LU mitigation, for instance, in 2100 only 15% of cumulated CDR from BECCS remain after subtracting bioenergy-induced LUC emissions. Before 2050, cumulated bioenergy-induced LUC emissions even exceed BECCS savings by far for all policy settings except UCP (Extended Data Fig. 5). Note that this only compares LUC emissions with direct CDR but does not account for fossil fuel substitution. While the substitution effect plays an important role in reducing emissions from fossil fuels, quantifying the avoided emissions attributed to the bioenergy part of BECCS is inherently ambiguous, as there are also other substitution options such as direct electrification in the integrated systems perspective.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 120}

The most common type is price reform, which we define as an increase in the nominal price of gasoline by 10% or more in local currency units in a single month. For robustness, we also track an alternative measure that indicates a nominal increase of 25% or more over 3 months (Extended Data Fig. 5). Price reform ends (or 'fails') if the subsidy returns to its pre-reform level, which can happen through two mechanisms: the government may explicitly reverse the price increase, a process we call backtracking; or the government may maintain the post-reform price, but its value disappears through inflation, a falling exchange rate or rising global oil prices. We refer to the latter process as erosion. The second type is fixity reform, which occurs when a government stops using fixed prices and subsidies altogether, allowing gasoline prices to fluctuate in response to changing oil prices for at least three consecutive months. A fixity reform can fail in two ways: if the government reimposes fixed prices for three or more consecutive months; or if the government interferes with the market price to restore a substantial subsidy (which we define as a subsidy exceeding 20 cents per litre in constant 2015 US dollars) for three consecutive months.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 122}

For electrofuels produced from green hydrogen and renewable carbon, these two factors dominate the overall costs (Extended Data Fig. 5g-l). Although electrolyser investment costs have recently surged1,17, this trend is expected to reverse soon due to learning by doing and economies of scale. Note again that to estimate the volume of required subsidies, we considered a scenario where all project announcements until 2030 are realized on time, while after 2030, cost reductions are driven by the median electrolysis capacity in 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 11). This leads to rapidly falling electrolyser costs (Supplementary Fig. 12). We used a payback period of 15 years to calculate the levelized costs (Methods), as well as to estimate the required subsidies (Extended Data Fig. 3); this period represents the typical length of implemented policy support such as auctions42 and is therefore more relevant for investment decisions than the technical lifetime.

On a 0-10 scale, the average support is 6.22 for removing industrial-use subsidies, 6.31 for removing subsidies on private consumption of fossil fuels and 6.33 for introducing a carbon tax. Apparently, the differences between these numbers are small. The statistical testing of the means (M) confirms this as well. When t testing the differences between the proposal of removing subsidies on private consumption (M = 6.31,  s.d. = 2.67) and the introduction of a carbon tax (M = 6.33, s.d. = 2.77), we find no statistically significant differences (t(1,893.16) = -0.1604, P = 0.4363). The first hypothesis is thus rejected. Nor do we find any differences between attitudes toward removing subsidies on industrial-use fossil fuels (M = 6.22, s.d. = 2.57) and subsidies on private consumption of fossil fuels (M = 6.31, s.d. = 2.67) (t(1,896.18) = 0.6985, P = 0.7575).

In Canada, carbon pricing preferences might have remained relatively stable despite rebates because the political benefits of revenue recycling came with policy announcement (before our wave 1), not during implementation (our panel period). Two pieces of evidence suggest this as unlikely. First, we find little baseline knowledge about the rebate in wave 1, which we would expect if anticipation of future rebates had already increased support (Supplementary Section 11). Second, the announcement of a federal rebate policy for Alberta occurred between waves 2 and 3, after a newly elected provincial government repealed the provincial tax, which did not provide universal rebates. This prompted the federal government to step in to announce it would impose a tax and rebate policy over the objection of the provincial government (as in Saskatchewan and Ontario.) However, we find no announcement effect in Alberta, where carbon pricing support trends roughly in parallel with other provinces after policy announcement (Fig. 1).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 126}

In rural CPA in the COVID scenario (top left panel of Fig. 3b), we see most households with very low incomes per capita (approximately less than US$5 per capita per day). We see a transition from high firewood dependence at lower income levels to almost equal shares of firewood, gas and electricity at the highest income levels. Households with middle-income levels could still rely mostly on biomass fuels. By contrast, among urban households (top left panel of Fig. 4b), income per capita levels are higher (up to approximately US$17 per capita per day). These households are likely to depend mostly on gas and electricity. The pattern varies greatly across other regions, even at comparable income levels. Nevertheless, overall, we see a strong income effect on the choice of cooking fuels, with households with higher levels of income transitioning to either gas or electricity in all regions, except in the Middle East and North Africa (MEA), a region rich in fossil fuels and poor in biomass. In MEA, higher-income households could continue to use cheap kerosene, in line with what we observed in the empirical data (see Methods section).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 128}

This emphasis arises largely from two targeted technical programmes at ARPA-E for battery technology in 2010\u2014one for electric vehicles and one for grid-scale storage.One important reason for this emphasis is that technology priorities at ARPA-E are determined in a bottom-up fashion, as they aim to fund 'white space', that is, technical areas that are overlooked by other funding sources39. This is a complementary approach to that of other offices in DOE, like EERE, where funds are allocated based on road-mapping of existing technological trajectories\u2014in other words, EERE funds are more likely to be subject to path dependencies in the programmes when compared to ARPA-E. EERE's top-down approach is reflected in its 2010 startup portfolio, which was more similar to the overall makeup of US cleantech companies.

As for fertility policies, they affect the population mainly in terms of size and structure, and thus affect the carbon footprints. In specific, our results show that the Chinese population will peak in 2023 (1.41 billion), 2030 (1.41 billion) and 2040 (1.44 billion) under the two-child, three-child and replacement-level policies, respectively (Fig. 2a). From 2017 to 2060, the total population will decrease from 1.40 billion to 1.15 billion (two-child policy), 1.30 billion (three-child policy) and 1.39 (replacement-level policy), which means the population differences are 12-20% under different policies (Fig. 2a). The mean population age of a person will increase from 38 years to 51 years (two-child policy), 47 years (three-child policy) and 45 years (replacement-level policy), thus, the proportion of older people will increase from 17% to 42% (two-child policy), 37% (three-child policy) and 35% (replacement- level policy) (Fig. 2b-e). Due to relaxing fertility policies, there is an 8-12% increase in per capita footprints (the blue, yellow and red solid curves in Fig. 3 (China)), and the total footprints in China are likely to be 21-35% higher.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 131}

There is little evidence that requiring prescribers/dispensers to check the PDMP reduced overdose mortality. We find a significant lead for all fatal opioid overdoses, implying that these requirements may have been implemented in response to high overdose rates. Considering when these particular policies were passed (Figure 1), they were implemented as prescription opioid overdose mortality was stabilizing and heroin overdoses were increasing. In fact, in models for heroin overdoses, we find a significant lead (b = 1.42, p < .01, for prescribers; b = .89, p < .001, for dispensers). Thus, as all opioid overdose mortality increased, U.S. states may have tried to strengthen PDMP  systems via these requirements, but this overdose rise was due to substances (heroin, fentanyl) less likely to be affected directly by such changes. We also find a significant lead for benzodiazepines. Separating benzodiazepine overdoses that did and did not include an opioid (not shown), we find only a significant lead when the overdose included an opioid such that it was unlikely that overdoses due solely to benzodiazepines drove this particular  policy adoption.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 132}

This may be due to the relative homogeneity among clinicians in terms of upbringing and class status (see Alsan, Garrick, and Graziani 2019; Carrese and Rhodes 1995). Providers from higher SES backgrounds with similar medical school education may hold shared beliefs about parental readiness, parenting, and the appropriateness of specific contraceptives for specific women (Stevens 2015). Moreover, providers' use of pregnancy risk data in their clinical decision-making may further reinforce these personal beliefs. We also note that white providers appeared to discuss their strategies to avoid biased care more explicitly relative to providers of color, although all providers did discuss these strategies. The emphasis on race-based bias trainings may hold some explanatory value. White providers learning about discrimination against racial minorities may be more inclined to reflect on their own approaches and more consciously develop coping strategies with which to navigate and minimize bias.

We categorized these challenges into (1) scope and scale discrepancies, (2) the bureaucratization of justice and (3) the weaponizing of justice. The first challenge in implementing climate justice is that it inherently requires action at multiple scales and beyond the scope of a single program. As stated by an interviewee, \u201cthe ordinance was reflective of some community priorities and goals that would never really be able to be addressed through just BERDO alone\u201d. In addition to the legal constraints attached to any given program, scope and scale discrepancies partially originate from the multiplicity of meanings of justice. For some, operationalizing justice in BERDO meant implementing the program in a way that avoids harm and distributes benefits inherently produced by building decarbonization. For others, justice also meant \u201cincreasing the pot of benefits that are on the table and then distributing those\u201d, potentially crossing the legal scope of BERDO.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 137}

Climatechange has little impact on regions facing positive or small negative crop yield impacts (Russia and West Asia (CSI), and theMiddle-East and North-Africa (MNA)) or maintaining a high cropyield (Latin American countries (LAC); Extended Data Fig. 1 (foraverage crop yield), Supplementary Figs. 1-4 (for the four maincrops)). Regions with negative impacts on medium crop yields facelarger hunger impacts (East Asia (EAS) and Southeast Asia (SEA)).South Asia (SAS) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) face the mostsevere hunger impacts from climate change. They experience negative impacts on already low yields, also when including the impactof supply-side adaptation on yields (Extended Data Fig. 2). Acrossthe RCP8.5 scenarios, projections for the baseline trade scenariorange from an increase of 13-181% and 2-51% in the population atrisk of hunger for SAS and SSA, respectively. The effect of the tradescenarios on regional undernourishment is largest among baselinenet-importing regions (SSA, MNA, EAS and SAS) and regions inwhich climate change reduces net exports (SEA; Extended DataFigs. 3 and 4). The fixed imports scenario enlarges hunger impactsin the extreme climate change scenario in SSA, SAS and SEA by raising agricultural prices (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), increasing netexports in SEA, and reducing net imports in SSA and SAS. Adverseeffects from trade restriction, such as the export bans observedduring the 2007-2008 world food crisis28,29 and those feared as aresult of the global COVID-19 pandemic30,31, may pose severehunger risks under climate change. Under the pre-Doha tariffsscenario undernourishment in SSA, SAS and EAS is substantiallyhigher compared with the baseline trade scenario. Tariff liberalization between 2001 and 2010 reduced average import tariffs in SSA,SAS and EAS by around 30% (Supplementary Table 6). The lower tariffs reduce the overall level of trade costs by 2050 (SupplementaryTable 7) and enable larger agricultural net imports in SSA, SASand EAS across all climate scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 3). Inthe MNA region, the average import tariff reduced marginally andin SEA it was already low (Supplementary Table 6). The facilication+tariff elimination scenario reduces hunger in the SSA, MNAand EAS regions across all climate scenarios by decreasing averagetrade costs (Supplementary Table 7), thereby reducing agriculturalprices and raising agricultural imports (Extended Data Figs. 3and 5). In some cases, trade integration increases rather thandecreases the level of undernourishment in a region under climate change. The largest adverse effects occur under the tariffelimination scenario in the SEA and SAS regions (Extended DataFig. 7). Whereas the facilitation scenario reduces hunger in theextreme climate change scenario by 16% and 8%, the tariff elimination scenario increases hunger impacts by 4% and 16% in SEAand SAS, respectively. Both trade scenarios reduce average tradecosts (Supplementary Table 7), but the tariff elimination scenarioincreases rice exports from SAS and SEA, thereby reducing domestic calorie availability. The facilication+tariff elimination scenariocompensates for calorie loss from rice exports through increasedimports of other agricultural goods and decreases the hunger effectof extreme climate change by 26% and 11% in SEA and SAS, respectively.

At the state level, more liberal policies expand economic regulations, protect marginalized groups, and are associated with longer life expectancies (Montez et al. 2020). Such policies are more likely to support women and be supported by women in power (Kavanagh and Graham 2019). Evidence from around the world also show that when women are empowered socially and politically, there are greater investments in education, health care, public health, and other social programs that tend to improve health for the entire population (Boehmer and Williamson 1996; Bolzendahl and Brooks 2007; Little, Dunn, and Deen 2001; Miller 2008; Young 2001). Differences in state-level policies can also affect health care use through barriers to accessing services, such as lack of insurance options like expansion of Medicaid, unavailability of flexible appointments, inadequate transportation, and poor social support for childcare, among other factors (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2018). This leads to the hypothesis that states with higher levels of structural sexism may offer less generous safety-net policies and allocate fewer resources to health care, leading to lower levels of preventive health care use among both men and women, as illustrated in Figure 1b. This pattern would be consistent with the findings of Homan (2019) that state-level structural sexism exposure was universally harmful for health, negatively impacting outcomes for both men and women.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 144}

The moderation in price spikes is clearer in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany and the Nordic countries, whereas for Italy, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and other countries in Eastern Europe, the changes would be very small. Our simulations confirm that exposure to natural gas is the main factor affecting the probability of price spikes in European markets in each country (Fig. 1).  The negative change in \u03b2-sensitivity from 2024 to 2030 is strongly correlated with the reduction in the tails of the price distribution, both for high and extreme episodes; countries that reduce the dependency of their markets on natural gas are those that also obtain a clearer mitigation of price spikes. This is an important result as it confirms the underlying rationale of European renewable deployment policies. By reducing the dependence on natural gas, they help achieve broader price stability. Because of this, in what follows, we focus on understanding what drives the evolution of \u03b2-sensitivity.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 145}

A majority of LT-LEDS do not explicitly mention the concept of residual emissions, despite having a net-zero target. Few countries provide an explicit definition or elaborate how residual emissions amounts are arrived at, explain what criteria were used to determine them or specify what greenhouse gases make up the residual emissions. The examples in Table 2 illustrate the variance in how countries describe residual emissions in LT-LEDS. Countries such as Switzerland and Norway suggest an absolute limit on abatement options by describing residual emissions as those that 'cannot' be completely eliminated. By contrast, France and Nepal exemplify a more fluid understanding, where the need for residual emissions owes to 'the current state of knowledge' and with the expectation that technological advancement might change this. Sweden explicitly mentions the ambition to minimize residual emissions as much as possible, suggesting at least some political leverage over the amount of residual emissions allowed in LT-LEDS.

For each county in the United States, we first select the conversion pathway for each type  of waste under each of the three scenarios. The national results are the aggregation of county-level results. The calculations are described in Methods and results are depicted in Table 3 and Fig. 3. Scenario results suggest that there is substantial benefit from utilizing wastes and biomass residues to either displace energy production or reduce GHG emissions or both. As one would expect, MEP results in the highest potential of renewable energy production, which totals 3.8 EJ\u20143.7% of total US energy demand in 2016 (ref. 46), and MER results in the highest potential of emissions reduction, 178 MtCO2 e\u20142.7% of total US GHG emissions in 2016 (ref. 47). The MNE scenario indicates the highest potential of net energy as well as a moderate amount of emissions reduction (75% of MER). A breakdown of scenario results by waste feedstock reveals the preferred conversion pathways under each of the three scenarios (Supplementary Table 4). CHP (E1) is the preferred option for agricultural resides under both the MEP and MNE scenarios, while either CHP (E1) or gasification (M1) may maximize GHG emission reduction depending on specific feedstock. For dairy manure, CHP (E1) is the preferred option that maximizes renewable energy production, but anaerobic digestion to biomethane (M2) maximizes both the net energy gains and climate benefits. For forest residues, CHP (E1) results in the largest amount of renewable energy and net energy gain, while either hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) with in situ hydrogen production (Bj5) or gasification (M1) maximizes GHG emission reduction. In contrast to other categories of wastes, optimal use of MSW feedstocks would require a greater number of conversion technology pathways depending on specific feedstock. Non-biogenic carbon in MSW is concentrated in three feedstocks\u2014 plastics, rubber and leather, and textiles. Thus, the non-biogenic carbon is immediately emitted into the atmosphere when processing these feedstocks instead of being stored in landfills. While the inclusion of biogenic CO2 reduces net GWP for forest residues and MSW (Fig. 1c,d), it does not change the ranking of conversion pathways under the three scenarios.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 149}

Pairwise estimates of statistical significance between different levels of education were performed using one-way analysis of variance. Maternal health reflects an average of the pooled estimates across the five study waves. Results demonstrate the educational gradient in maternal health. As mothers' baseline level of educational attainment increased, their overall self-rated health increased, and their reports of parenting stress, having poor mental health, and having recently smoked decreased. The rate of smoking was four times greater for mothers with less than a high school degree than for mothers with a bachelor's degree (36% vs. 8%). Differences in mental health were also noteworthy, albeit smaller (26% vs. 14%). Patterns for overall health represented a 55% of a standard deviation (overall SD = 1.05) difference between mothers with the highest and lowest levels of education.

Of these, we used 110 projects with sufficient detail on annual costs and revenues to perform a simple calculation to examine their dependency on these schemes (note that existing projects are not affected by cuts to FITs rates and the closure of the FIT and RO schemes, see Methods for details). We find that 92% of these projects (101 projects) were in financial surplus (that is, total annual revenues exceeded total annual costs) for the year for which data were provided; however, after removing the price scheme revenues, only a fifth of the projects (22 projects) were in surplus. As these projects were designed to draw on FITs or similar revenue streams, it is not surprising that removing those revenues would push many projects into deficit.

This is exemplified by the competition between green hydrogen and natural gas, which is relevant for end uses such as industry, power and grid injection (Fig. 5a,b), as well as between green hydrogen and grey hydrogen, covering the end uses ammonia, refining and some biofuel routes (Fig. 5c,d). Together, these account for over 90% of the announced electrolyser capacity by 2030 (Extended Data Fig. 2). In contrast, project announcements for electrofuels remain limited, which may be due to a larger cost gap to the fossil competitors in the respective end uses (Extended Data Fig. 5g-l). Without carbon pricing, the cost gap between green hydrogen and natural gas of US$150 MWh-1 in 2024 implies that green hydrogen is initially more than seven times as expensive as natural gas (Fig. 5a), while the cost gap between green hydrogen and grey hydrogen is only slightly lower at US$121 MWh-1 in 2024 (Fig. 5c). As green hydrogen costs decrease, the cost gap gradually reduces, but typically prevails also into the long term. This pattern holds across all end uses. Without carbon pricing, in our central estimate, no green product becomes competitive with its fossil competitor until 2050.

The space category shows some of the highest and lowest dismantling ages, which range from 3.8 to 32.9 years with a median value of 17.4 years. The average age for the noise category is 22.1 years, the highest of all groups, which suggests that older turbines more commonly induce a violation of noise emission limits. Those older turbines are mechanically louder and have less sound insulation than newer turbines, as stated by one of the interviewees.In seven of the eight categories, both the median and average value for the operating turbine lifetime are <20 years. This is surprising because turbines installed in Denmark between 1996 and 2008 are guaranteed government support for 20 years34. Hence, many of these turbines forego support payments because of dismantling. This reinforces the idea that repowering is seldom a technical end-of-lifetime decision or even an end-of-support decision. One interviewee stated that they continuously monitor their fleet of existing turbines and evaluate the turbines' economic viability to include them or not in a new repowering project; hence, the current age of the existing turbine is, in itself, largely irrelevant, and merely a parameter in the broader economic evaluation.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 156}

Hence, the following analyses focus specifically on the question of timing. While Fig. 2 indicates that the timeline does indeed have a considerable effect on citizens' preferences, there may be differences between population subgroups. In particular, it has been suggested that party identification structures people's energy policy preferences27,28. Germany's party elites represent opposing views on the coal phase-out, ranging from the Greens' position for an early phase-out to the conservative parties tending to defend the status quo29. In the context of the 2017 federal elections, the partisan divide on the topic became highly visible, and the question of timing was one of the reasons why the negotiations for a government coalition of the Christian Democrats, the Liberal Democrats (FDP) and the Green Party failed in November 201730. Figure 3a shows that there is some variation among partisans with regard to the strength of their timing preferences. Unsurprisingly, Green Party supporters show the strongest preference for an early phase-out in 2025. What may be more surprising is that supporters of almost all other parties also prefer 2025 over 2040. The only exception is the relatively small subsample supporting the Bavarian arm of the CSU, where the preference for 2025 is not significant. In contrast to public statements by their party leaders, FDP and Green Party voters have similar views on this issue. For all respondents, phasing out in 2100 is the least preferred timeline, although supporters of the right-wing populist party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) are comparatively more positive about such a late phase-out date than supporters of all other parties. In light of other surveys investigating public attitudes on the German energy transition (either surveys with a broad focus31 or those with a specific focus on the coal phase-out32), the muted differences across different partisans actually reflect a recurring pattern.

Specifically, from 2022-2050, about 70% of countries (97 out of 138) have larger indirect than direct cumulative emission reductions (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, we find that indirect emission reductions are far more equally distributed across countries than direct emission reductions (Fig. 2b). This result also suggests that the total reductions in emissions from policy adoption and diffusion are more equally distributed than only direct domestic emission reductions. For simplicity, we assume that carbon pricing policies reduce  GHG emissions by the same rate r = 1% per year in all countries relative to a situation without a carbon pricing policy. This rate is conservative compared to known reductions in emissions in existing ETSs and estimated reductions for carbon taxes (Methods). In a sensitivity analysis, we vary the value of this parameter between 0.1% and 10% and find that this changes the number of countries with larger indirect than direct emission reductions by only a few percentage points (Supplementary Fig. 7).

However, the most effective policy combination under ASIA is that of R and E, with an average timeline of reaching carbon neutrality by 2059.

The average economic costs under ISSA and ASIA differ considerably (Fig. 2b).

Nevertheless, under ASIA, the best policy combination from the economic side changes to the highest level of R and E.

These projections are prone to only minor downward adjustments, as indicated by the difference between OLS and WLS results (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 and Supplementary Table 2), and are consistently more optimistic than those from scientific literature (p < 0.05, two-tailed t-test; Supplementary Table 4). Conversely, scientific cost estimates published in 2010-2023 faced substantial downward adjustments. Hence, battery costs have experienced a more rapid decline than initially expected, at least in the scientific community. This echoes Nykvist and Nilsson25, who found similar divergences for industry vs market leaders vs peer-reviewed literature estimates and supports conclusions from Frith et al.32, who emphasize substantial gaps between academic and industry perspectives. One explanation might be that near-market sources may have more practical in-depth knowledge about technologies, manufacturing or cost-saving measures and better access to industry insights such as market trends, partnerships, supply chain dynamics or confidential pricing data. In contrast, parts of the scientific literature may be classified as theoretical estimates or may be affected by citation patterns or time-delaying review processes, leading to the self-confirmation of outdated values and assumptions.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 162}

We find that the interpretation and implementation of legislation is not straightforward and varies by institution. An ever-changing legislative landscape combined with different institutional interpretations of legal restrictions produces uncertainty for those working in reproductive health care settings. This uncertainty occurs within a climate of fear and stigma surrounding abortion care provision in restrictive contexts, impacting health care professions differently depending on their professional status and proximity to abortion care. We argue that a political context that produces uncertainty can result in more limiting interpretations and implementation of legal restrictions than necessitated by the law, thereby amplifying the impacts of an already restrictive context. This chilling effect captures how the political context of care can constrain care beyond what law and policy dictate because clinicians and institutions err on the side of caution when uncertain whether providing clinically appropriate care is legal. With Roe overturned, the legislative context remains in flux such that reproductive rights depend on one's state of residence (McCann 2022). Practicing in a state of uncertainty is more relevant than ever for many health care providers.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 164}

We found that, although all households on TOU face bill increases relative to controls, those vulnerable on the elderly and disability indicators face greater bill increases on TOU versus control than their nonvulnerable counterparts. Conversely, low-income and Hispanic households face relatively smaller bill increases on TOU versus control than their non-vulnerable counterparts.

Relative to their non-vulnerable counterparts, households vulnerable on disability and Hispanic indicators face an increased likelihood of negative health outcomes when assigned to TOU, and low-income households face increased discomfort.

Results using winsorized per cent deforestation and per cent deforestation as outcomes tell the same story (Supplementary Tables B6 and B7).

Although the differences are not substantively large, these findings suggest that a small fraction of the rising IOL rates among states' Latina women are associated with changes in the demographics and risk factors of the states' Latina childbearing populations. Yet states' IOL rates among Latina women are also statistically and substantively associated with changes in demographic characteristics and risk factors among states' White childbearing populations (\u201cEquation (4)-White,\u201d Appendix G in the online version of the article). As shown in Figure 3 (Panel B), the \u201cControl White Characteristics\u201d line (solid gray) indicates that the average IOL rate among pregnancies to Latina women would not have substantively increased between 1990 and 2017 if states' White childbearing populations had not experienced changes in their demographic composition or maternal risk factors.

The wide variation in projected mitigation potentials across models (51-85% for buildings and 37-91% for transport) reveals the high level of  uncertainty that arises from the complexity of modelling future energy-demand development.The impact of the selected set of demand-side interventions is high: on average, across the models, 65% reduction of direct CO2emissions in buildings and nearly 70% in transport by 2050, compared to a current policies scenario. Activity-focused measures result in reductions by 2050 of 6-23% for buildings and 17-28% for transport, technology-optimizing measures to 11-33% and 2-67%, respectively, and electrification-focused measures to 45-77% and 22-86%.

The estimates are interpreted in relation to a reference temperature range (daily average temperatures between 20\u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C). These estimates are also re-estimated by the level of electricity use and climate zones.The probability of a same-day disconnection occurring on any given day (except during weekends and public holidays when disconnection is prohibited) is high (0.04-0.06) and increases on the first day that credit can expire, predominantly the next business day (approximately 0.19). This is captured in our results, with a large  increase in disconnections occurring on Monday and the day after a public holiday (Fig. 4).

Further, we use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores to assess the prediction accuracy of model variations including different combinations of the demographic factors (Supplementary Table 6). The AIC scores likewise suggest that race and housing tenure are the most predictive variables.

Using 39 waves of PSID data to measure both cumulative union membership during a respondent's career between ages 18 and 60 and physical health at ages 60 to 79, we draw three main sets of conclusions. First, we find that the accumulated history of unionization contributes to older adulthood health. Among older adults, those who spent the entirety of their career in unions have better self-rated health, fewer functional limitations, and fewer life- threatening chronic conditions than those who were partially or never union members.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 174}

This would be 40% lower than the situation in 2024, where the electricity price would be expected to increase by 1.4 euros.Interpreting the results for \u03b2-sensitivity requires some clarification. For combined cycle gas turbines (the majority of natural gas power plants in 2024 and the 2030 plans), we assume a thermal efficiency of 49% (ref. 22), implying a gas plant must burn 2.05 MWh of natural gas to obtain 1 MWh of electricity. Because of this, if the annual price of electricity reacted one to one with the marginal costs of natural gas plants, we would expect the increase in the price of electricity of 2.05 euros when the price of gas went up by one euro. Our \u03b2-sensitivity estimates indicate that by 2030, the price of electricity would reflect 50% of the increase in the short-run marginal cost of gas plants compared to 70% today (that is, 0.7 = 1.4/2.05).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 175}

With revenue recycling, the model recommends high decarbonization initially\u2014there are dual benefits of redistributable revenue and lower future temperatures\u2014but postpones full decarbonization for many decades as redistribution continues (Fig. 5). Without the equal per capita revenue recycling, the model at first recommends more moderate ambition, to protect the current poor from high mitigation costs, followed by a rapid increase in decarbonization to avoid extreme warming. Despite this different temporal pattern of mitigation, the maximum temperature rise is similar in both scenarios, although it peaks later with revenue recycling, a potentially valuable delay if it reduces the rate of temperature change and enables more time for adaptation34. The carbon tax and carbon dividend trajectories corresponding to the decarbonization paths are reported in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8.

While the exact timing of cost parity remains highly uncertain, a relative sequence of hydrogen end-use competitiveness can be derived (Fig. 5b,d and Extended Data Fig. 5, right column). In our central estimate, green hydrogen first becomes competitive with grey hydrogen in 2034 (for example, for ammonia and refining), followed by green hydrogen becoming competitive with diesel in 2037 (for mobility), e-methanol becoming competitive with grey methanol in 2043 (for example, for chemicals), and green hydrogen becoming competitive with natural gas in 2044 (for example, for industry and power). In our central estimate, e-kerosene and e-methane narrowly miss reaching cost parity with their fossil competitors by 2050 (Extended Data Fig. 5h,l). Thus, even with ambitious carbon pricing, the cost gap persists for at least one decade, depending on the end use and the scenario.

Only in hotel 5, the energy use per shower differs significantly from the other hotels, which may be due to different infrastructure (for example, more low-flow shower heads) or guest characteristics. Otherwise, the impact on energy use per shower is very similar between the different hotels.

First of all, one can see between period (1) and period (2), when the MSR reform was negotiated and implemented, actors presumably started to look further into the future. When turning to period (1) before 2018, one notices that observed ETS prices are closer to the modelled prices for myopic actors than to the modelled prices for farsighted actors. It seems therefore plausible to assume that market actors behaved at least partially myopically, which is in line with earlier assessments7. For periods (2) and (3), one observes the opposite: both, the 2019-2020 observed ETS prices of \u20ac20-30 tCO2-1 and the 2021-2022 ones of \u20ac70-90 tCO2-1, are consistent with the modelled prices for farsighted actors (that is, perfect foresight trajectories for old 'MSR reform' targets, and new 'Fit for 55' targets, respectively).

Whether these technologies, especially untested ones such as BECCS, can be deployed at the speed and scale needed for deep decarbonization depends on a variety of factors, such as economic cost, land use constraints and other sustainability considerations43,44. In addition, while our model allows for a certain degree of flexibility for inter-state trade of electricity and bioliquids, we often observe inflexibility of energy investments and trade in the real world, due to physical and regulatory constraints on electricity transmission, biomass resources, opposition to pipelines, etc.43-46.

With a first-difference linear regression model, we found that a 1,000-unit ZIP-code-level reduction in HyADS exposure from the  year prior to the year after the Q2-2015 energy transitions resulted in, on average, 2.2 fewer asthma hospitalizations and ERVs (95% CI: -4.5, 0.2) per ZIP code per year and a first-difference model that specified categories of \u0394HyADS showed the largest effect for the highest \u0394HyADS category (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Specifically, the former case (referredto as 'Integrated' outfalls) accounted for the hydraulic coupling of waterlevels in open channels at the outfalls, mimicking the real-world floodcondition to the best of our abilities. In the latter case ('Controlled'),all stormwater at the outfalls is assumed to discharge freely into thereceiving channel of Bear Creek; that is, the outflow is controlled tohave the rate of a pipe with a free overall downstream condition, notimpeded by the presence of the receiving water body. Comprehensivehydrodynamic modeling of these two distinct scenarios of outfallfunctioning reveals peculiar results. Notably, with the outfalls hydraulically disconnected (the 'Controlled' case) from the rest of the floodedwatershed, the resultant flooding is more extreme than that of the integrated outfall case, which facilitated backwater effects (Fig. 2d,f).Specifically, in areas near the outfalls at the Bear Creek channel, inundation levels for the 'Controlled' case exceeded the 'Integrated' caseby over 0.1 m (Figs. 2g and 3a-c). This result can be explained by theconsiderable drainage from the 'Controlled' sewer system discharginginto the open channel: water levels at the outfall sites thus tend to behigher and cause more severe flooding in nearby areas. In contrast,in the more realistic 'Integrated' case, if the water level in the channelexceeds the hydraulic head of the stormwater system at the outfalllocation, backwater flow will occur and water from the open channelwill flow into the sewer system. This results in lower water levels in nearoutfall areas experiencing backwater, leading to reduced flooding inthe 'Integrated' case. Conversely, with large discharges entering thesewer system, upstream areas (such as in the southern region) canbe impacted when the sewer's rainwater intake capacity is reduced,potentially increasing flooding due to slower drainage.Neglecting the connectivity between a sewer system and adjacentflooded areas and consequent backwater effects can overestimateflood levels. This can potentially result in poor design of the number,positioning and dimensions of manholes, pipes and outfalls. Larger sewers and outfall dimensions can facilitate rapid drainage, yet theycan also allow rapid backflow. As shown in Fig. 3d,e, a large outfall (witha diameter of 3.8 m) can discharge high flows (up to 40.9 m3 s-1) in th'Controlled' case, whereas the backflow into the sewer can be up to63.5 m3s-1 in the 'Integrated' case. The smaller outfall (with the diameterof 0.3 m) had lower discharge and backflow (up to 9.7 and 16.7 m3 s-1 forthe controlled and integrated cases, respectively).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 190}

While carbon neutrality could be achieved in 23.5% of the scenarios under ISSA, it could be achieved in only 3.7% of the scenarios under ASIA. This suggests that because of policy interactions, the percentage of scenarios in which the carbon neutrality target could be achieved by 2060 decreases substantially by 84%. Furthermore, the timeline of achieving carbon neutrality under ASIA is expected to be delayed by ~5-6 years compared with that under ISSA. For scenarios in which the carbon neutrality target is successfully achieved, the average year achieving carbon neutrality is 2054 under ISSA but 2059 under ASIA.

Few companies (6%) report scope 2 SBTs independent from other emission scopes. Most companies (82%) report scope 2 SBTs in combination with SBTs for scope 1 (covering direct emissions24) and the rest (12%) in combination with scope 1 and scope 3 SBTs (covering value chain emissions beyond scope 2; ref. 24). Most companies (89%) state that their SBT refers to market-based  accounting, whereas the SBTs of the remaining 11% refer to location-based accounting (in short, market- and location-based SBTs). This indicates that most companies aim to use RECs and PPAs in pursuing their targets. Companies with market-based SBTs tend to commit to more ambitious emission reductions (compare the orange and blue boxes in Fig. 3a). The trend is especially pronounced for SBTs covering scopes 1 and 2, where the median annual reduction is 1.7 percentage points higher for market- over location-based SBTs (4.2% versus 2.5% of base year emissions). This may be because market-based accounting offers a relatively low-cost means of appearing to reduce emissions14, and therefore companies using this approach are willing to set more ambitious reduction targets; 58% of market-based SBTs align with the 1.5 \u00b0C goal (below purple line in Fig. 3a) and 28% with the well below 2 \u00b0C goal (between the turquoise and purple line). The corresponding shares for location-based SBTs are 8% and 54%, respectively.

In our central specification of DAC potential and costs (Global North, low costs), the between-country effect of CO2 removal is an order of magnitude lower than the within-country one around the time of net zero. At the end of the century, the effect is more relevant because the total cost of removal peaks, but it is insufficient to compensate for within-country regressivity. An allocation of removal potential towards the Global South consistently exacerbates global inequality, unless trade of carbon removal is considered. In this case, poorer countries could benefit from selling negative emissions permits to wealthy countries (see Supplementary Annex E for a simulation of international transfers). On the contrary, relaxing the assumption that capital is owned exclusively by each country's citizens would increase between-country inequality because most financial centres are located in the Global North (see Supplementary Annex D for a scenario including international ownership of capital). Assuming higher costs of negative emissions amplifies their between-country distributional effects. At the same time, it reduces the within-country regressivity because it decreases the profit margin for NET companies. Towards the end of the century, under a progressive allocation of removal potential (Global North, high costs) the two effects roughly counterbalance (bottom-right panel of Fig. 5). These results indicate that a progressive international distribution of removal effort, or a properly designed set of international transfers (Supplementary Annex E), can indeed contribute to reducing global inequality. However, especially under the assumption of cheap NETs and around net zero, our results suggest that the within-country inequality increase is more relevant in shaping the global income distribution.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 196}
