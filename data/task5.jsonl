However, the future demand and production of batteries remain uncertain, while the ambition to strengthen national capabilities and self-sufficiency is gaining momentum. In this study, leveraging probabilistic modelling, we assessed Europe\u2019s capability to meet its future demand for high-energy batteries via domestic cell production. We found that demand in Europe is likely to exceed 1.0\u2009TWh\u2009yr\u22121 by 2030 and thereby outpace domestic production, with production required to grow at highly ambitious growth rates of 31\u201368%\u2009yr\u22121. European production is very likely to cover at least 50\u201360% of the domestic demand by 2030, while 90% self-sufficiency seems feasible but far from certain. Thus, domestic production shortfalls are more likely than not.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 0}

This would most probably be the case for re-risking fossil fuel investments, which tends to provoke opposition from fossil fuel and related industries. Yet we find re-risking to be positively correlated with the stringency of national climate policy.

A well-known principle in the economics of uncertainty is that risk-averse agents would prefer a stable consumption stream to another that, having the same expected value, has a higher dispersion. Extending this insight to a social welfare framework, the literature, starting with Lucas17, has investigated the economic costs of aggregate macroeconomic fluctuations under different views of societal preferences. Similarly to the case made for advancing renewables to reap environmental benefits, if private agents fail to consider the benefits of stabilization, there would be an economic argument to consider this insurance value in the design of policies to expand renewables.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 40}

The uniform-price auction or pay as clear nature of price setting in day-ahead European electricity markets, coupled with strong restrictions on capacity markets as sources of revenue for power plants, has been a hotly debated issue30. In this design, the marginal costs of the most expensive plants required to satisfy demand set the price for all transactions in the market. Critics of the current design argue that this feature gives a disproportionate role to fossil fuel prices, and particularly natural gas, in the determination of electricity prices and impedes consumers from fully capturing the benefits of additional renewable power generation31.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 41}

Lower energy demand reduces emissions and also allows for greater flexibility in technology choices within supply sectors by lowering the overall energy production and associated investment requirements2. Two critical demand-side sectors include buildings (encompassing residential and service-sector buildings) and transport (encompassing aviation, navigation and land transport) that each represented 29% of global final energy consumption in 20196 and, respectively, 19% and 7% of direct energy-related greenhouse gas emissions7.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 44}

For the new EU Renewable Energy Directive III, energetic usage of primary forest residues was proposed to be excluded as an option for meeting renewable targets118, which alone have been estimated to amount to up to 1.6\u2009PWh per year in Europe83, or up to 600\u2009Mt biogenic CO2 that could potentially be captured (Extended Data Table 2). Excluding comparably easy-to-monitor domestic resources might lead to a substantially higher cost of the energy system and to a higher demand for imported biomass and dedicated crops, with harder-to-foresee environmental consequences.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 66}

It covers the electricity sector, large-scale industrial installations, aviation and maritime transport and hence controls above 40% of the European Union\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions1. Over a period with two major reforms of the ETS and notably a substantial tightening of the cap, the carbon market underwent a remarkable transition: carbon prices increased tenfold within four years, with a first rise in 2018 from below \u20ac10 tCO2\u22121 to a plateau at \u20ac20\u201330 tCO2\u22121 in 2019\u20132020 and then a second, even sharper, rise during which prices repeatedly reached almost \u20ac100 tCO2\u22121 in 2021 and 20222.

Similarly, China is anticipated to tighten its tail-pipe emissions reduction targets soon to comply with its near-zero emissions target by 20607,8. These ambitions require the fast deployment of zero-emission trucks (ZETs), where demand from and, hence, affordability for operators are key.

Figure 2 summarizes the findings of legal protections reviewed across these five indicators and illustrates the compounding disparities; a settlement was considered to lack protections if not all customers (both prepay and post-pay) were guaranteed that protection. We use multiple logistic regression to examine whether remote communities and Indigenous communities are statistically more likely to be underserved by electricity regulations.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 155}

The first is the relative effectiveness of each policy type in reducing oil production and associated GHG emissions, which to date, has received limited empirical analysis10\u201312. The second pertains to the ancillary benefits and costs of each policy and how they are distributed across different communities. In particular, oil extraction tends to be highly spatially concentrated in certain areas, employing a local workforce and generating air pollution impacting nearby residents. Depending on how oil extraction is spatially located in relation to workers and households, different supply-side policies can have different aggregate and distributional consequences in terms of health benefits and labour-market impacts. For example, for the same overall GHG emissions target, a policy that phases out more labour-intensive oil fields may have higher lost worker compensation than other policies. Likewise, a policy that bans oil fields near where disadvantaged households reside may generate larger overall health benefits and health equity gains. Quantifying such potential consequences is critical for informing the design of supply-side policies.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 180}

For all oil fields in California (Fig. 1a), we first construct an empirically estimated model of crude oil-well entry (Fig. 1b), production and exit at the oil-field level to project how various supply-side policies and macroeconomic conditions affect oil production across California oil fields out to 2045 (Methods and Supplementary Notes 8\u201311, 16 and 17).

The attack has also led to a negative supply shock of oil, partly because Russia\u2019s ability to export has been hampered by the lack of will to insure Russian ships3, but also due to industry preparation for the upcoming EU oil import ban4. Together with surging post-pandemic demand, this has led to very high prices of transport fuels5,6. In response, a large number of European countries are either discussing or have already implemented a reduction in fuel taxes to help consumers cope with high prices. Such tax reductions have problematic consequences since they increase demand, thus making current supply even more scarce. Some of the tax reduction will be attenuated by an increase in the underlying oil price, leading to increased profits for oil producers. Here, we assess the magnitude of this effect using basic theory and empirical estimates from the oil sector.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 195}

Wu et al.6 provide a power grid simulation to conduct a very detailed analysis of the 2021 event, and Doss-Gollin et al.7 have shown that lower temperatures than those in February 2021 have been observed in the past 71\u2009years, and heating demand predicted from temperature data would also have been higher in the past, although the 2021 freeze event was comparably long. These previous studies indicate a striking gap between the occurrence probability of such an event, its large-scale economic and social cost and the lack of winterization efforts. However, none of these studies assessed whether the economic incentives for power companies to invest in winterization have been sufficient, when the 2021 event is put into a long-term climatic context. As winterization was not strongly enforced by regulation in Texas, power generators had to rely on the incentives provided by the energy-only market to arrive at investment decisions. These incentives consist mainly of regulated price spikes at the spot market when generation capacity is scarce8.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 210}

The enormous social, public health and environmental benefits of transitioning to cleaner cooking underpin the inclusion of a universal access target for this under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG\u20097)1\u20133. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed that efforts to provide clean fuels and stoves have been lagging far behind those aimed at extending electricity access4. A recent report claims that this sluggish progress in providing clean cooking access is costing the world more than US$2 trillion each year as a result of health impacts, productivity losses and environmental degradation5. Mounting evidence of the impacts of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 mortality makes universal access to clean cooking services more urgent6,7. Despite this, emerging evidence suggests that the economic fallout of the pandemic might pose a further setback to efforts to reach this goal, as many are forced to climb down the energy ladder8\u201310.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 240}

We estimate an average expenditure gap of US$10.5 billion annually between 2020 and 2030, comparing the reference SSP3 and COVID scenarios. These estimates are an order of magnitude lower than the US$2 trillion of estimated losses incurred each year from a lack of access5. Recent commitments pledged to COVID-19 recovery funds are in the range US$9\u201315 trillion34,35.

In urban centres, providing piped gas to dense settlements and introducing smaller LPG cylinder sizes, pay-for-service financing models, smart metering for gas with electronic payment options as well as more reliable and affordable electricity can be instrumental in encouraging a more rapid transition to clean cooking. For rural regions, awareness-raising and behaviour change campaigns are also important to ensure that those who gain access use new stoves regularly41.

Here we present a quantitative analysis of business models, financing mechanisms and financial performance of UK community energy projects, based on a new survey. We find that business models depend on technology, project size and the fine-tuning of operations to local contexts. Although larger projects rely more on loans, community shares are the most common and cheapest financial instrument in the sector. Community energy has pioneered low-cost citizen finance for renewables, but its future is threatened by reductions, and instability, in policy support. Over 90% of the projects in our sample make a financial surplus during our single-year snapshot, but this falls to just 20% if we remove income from price guarantee mechanisms, such as the Feed-in Tariff scheme.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 365}

However, at the same time, sustainable use of this resource hinges on overcoming some challenges. The collection, transport and storage of biomass feedstocks are costly and could account for over 50% of total cost in the supply chain of bioenergy products25. The composition of wastes also varies from one location to another, and their processing requires substantial energy inputs. In addition, national-scale policies tend to ignore local trade-offs, leading to suboptimal use of scarce resources26. Harnessing the full energetic and environmental potential of this resource, therefore, requires a holistic assessment of alternative competing pathways to their utilization taking into account the spatial distribution of each specific type of waste and the local conditions under which the wastes will be processed.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 394}

As approximately two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from the energy sector4, the rapid deployment of low-carbon energy technologies, such as renewable energy technologies (RETs), is crucial for emissions reductions5. Solar photovoltaics (PVs) and wind will probably play central roles in this transition6. Importantly, as RETs are more capital intensive than fossil fuel technologies, large portions of their life-cycle cost are incurred upfront and need to be financed7,8.

Thus, providing real-time feedback on a specific energy-intensive activity may generate large and persistent savings effects25 not only among the small percentage of the population who tend to opt into energy efficiency studies11,20,21,23; the results indicate that the intervention successfully induces substantial behaviour change and resource conservation among broader audiences.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 478}

Oil-producing countries in the Middle East, in particularly the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, have become unexpected leaders in this movement with record-low power purchase agreement prices, below 3\u00a2\u2009kWh\u22121, for a number of new photovoltaic installations, beating the cost of fossil fuel generation. In this Analysis, we bring together technical, economic and financial information from global and local sources to study whether these prices can be replicated elsewhere and further reduced. We find that hardware costs, cost of labour, favourable cost of capital, low taxes and low, but positive, profit margins contribute to the reduction in costs. Reduced hardware prices contributed the most and also led to further reduction in cost of capital. We demonstrate how similar costs can be and have been achieved in other markets.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 498}

Almost all of the interventions reported as active in Australia\u2019s tropical waters were occurring in the Great Barrier Reef region (92%). These interventions were predominantly to support coral reef restoration, for example, through re-seeding coral, breeding of heat-resistant coral symbionts and coral reef habitat restoration and creation (6%, 4% and 2% of all reported interventions). Multiple types of interventions active within the same ocean region were reported almost without exception, with 96% of the interventions occurring in the same ocean region as at least one other type of intervention (Fig. 1b).\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 528}

For example, in the North Atlantic and in tropical waters adjacent to Australia, the range of interventions described includes those in all intervention types. This co-occurrence may present additional under-recognized governance challenges for policy- and decision-makers who are faced with both prioritizing across interventions and managing their cumulative and synergistic impacts within a single marine region. We found that formal consideration of trade-offs between intervention risks and benefits and assessment of cumulative impacts are not widely occurring governance practices (reported as occurring for only 31 and 32% of interventions, respectively). The results suggest that many decision-makers are materially underprepared for these strategic challenges, which extend beyond managing the risks posed by single interventions22,30,32.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 538}

Standard backward-looking risk models can show a high-carbon portfolio to be relatively low risk, even if there is a possibility of a rapid transition to green energy (see Discussion). Although it is arguably difficult to take an objective stance on the correct estimate of risk for these investments on a forward-looking basis, our analysis is sufficient to show that the structure of model-based risk frameworks may have an unintended side effect that is potentially in conflict with the purpose of the regulations or other societal goals.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 612}

First, remunerating negative emissions reduces the amount of carbon tax revenues potentially available to tackle inequality and alleviate poverty12 (revenue drying effect). Second, if these technologies are privately owned and are allowed to reap windfall profits due to increasing carbon prices, their financing will disproportionately benefit the high end of the income distribution that holds stocks and capital (ownership effect). Since the carbon tax is expected to be mostly regressive12\u201314 and equity ownership is concentrated at the top of the income distribution, both mechanisms can increase inequality and erode the support for the ambitious climate goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 638}

Using a Shapley\u2013Owen decomposition, we can isolate the contribution of each economic flux to the total inequality variation (bars in Fig. 3a): the percentage of inequality increase due to NET financing increases with brackets.

At the same time, it reduces the within-country regressivity because it decreases the profit margin for NET companies. Towards the end of the century, under a progressive allocation of removal potential (Global North, high costs) the two effects roughly counterbalance (bottom-right panel of Fig. 5). These results indicate that a progressive international distribution of removal effort, or a properly designed set of international transfers, can indeed contribute to reducing global inequality. However, especially under the assumption of cheap NETs and around net zero, our results suggest that the within-country inequality increase is more relevant in shaping the global income distribution.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 640}

These indirect emission reductions can be interpreted as a quantitative measure of the international leverage of a country in terms of global GHG emission reductions due to future diffusion of its policy. Overall, our results suggest that the magnitude of indirect emission reductions can be substantial. With our empirically estimated parameters, future indirect emission reductions will be larger than domestic emission reductions in 63% of countries that did not have a carbon pricing policy in place by the end of 2021. This evidence for large positive spillovers of domestic climate policy adoption provides additional support for the adoption of stringent climate policies, especially in countries in which climate policies might so far have been deemed to have relatively little importance because of a relatively small domestic economy.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 661}

What is considered true often depends on group membership rather than scientific evidence and facts1\u20136. This politicization is seen in numerous topics, including climate change. Overwhelming scientific evidence suggests that climate change is occurring7, is caused by human activity8 and is likely to result in dire consequences9,10. Nonetheless, actions of governments around the world lag behind what climate scientists say is needed. In some cases, this inaction is related to a lack of concern about climate change. For example, in the United States, surveys show that over a third of the population believes that the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated11, and more than half the population disagrees with the claim that climate change is caused by humans12.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 677}

The majority of strategies were imprecise about which sectors residual emissions would originate from, and few offered specific projections of how residual emissions could be balanced by carbon removal. Our findings indicate the need for a consistent definition of residual emissions, as well as processes that standardize and compare expectations about residual emissions across countries.

In theory, there are two main ways to estimate the amount of residual emissions at mid-century. The first is a top-down approach that starts with a specified national policy target (such as 85% or 90% of emissions from a baseline year) and either simply sets residual emissions equal to that or uses economy-wide or sector-specific modelling to figure out how to solve for it. The second is a bottom-up stakeholder-informed approach that estimates possible reductions in each sector then aggregates those sectoral estimates. In principle, a third approach is also possible\u2014one that begins with negative emissions, with either a top-down approach that starts with a target sink capacity or a bottom-up approach that estimates the capacity for each source of carbon removals and then projects allowable residual emissions equal to that amount. However, countries are not at present using an approach that leads with negative emissions.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Study Methods", "id": 699}

To this end, science-based targets (SBTs) intend to align voluntary company-level emission reduction targets with the global temperature goal of the Paris Agreement4\u20136. So far SBTs have been set by more than 1,000 companies, including many multinationals7,8. When reporting scope 2 emissions, that is, emissions associated with the generation of purchased energy (primarily electricity, but also including steam, heat and cooling), the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) allows companies to use renewable energy certificates (RECs) to claim the use of renewably generated electricity. Companies can then report zero emissions for each unit of electricity consumption covered by purchased RECs9, regardless of the actual emissions produced by the electricity grid at their location; however, RECs do not reflect the physical electricity flow supplied to the companies purchasing them10, and there is evidence that RECs are unlikely to lead to additional renewable energy generation11\u201318. Consequently, company-level emission reductions reported through RECs are unlikely to reflect real reductions of global emissions, which has the potential to compromise the alignment of SBTs with the Paris temperature goal19,20. In recognition of this issue, several emission accounting standards21,22 restrict or do not endorse the use of RECs, but RECs are nevertheless permitted by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol9 that forms the basis of SBTi\u2019s requirements.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 762}

This real emission reduction is driven by decarbonization of the residual electricity grid (representing the grid mix without the energy production that has been claimed by RECs or PPAs; see Box 1) (Fig. 1b) and to a lesser extent by a net-increase in company use of PPAs (Fig. 1c). By contrast, the increase in energy consumption had a net-positive contribution to the change in emissions (Fig. 1a).\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 764}

Information was obtained using a five-wave panel survey that tracked public attitudes before, during and after implementation of Canada\u2019s 2019 carbon tax and dividend policy and a large-scale survey of Swiss residents. Experimental provision of individualized information about true rebate amounts had modest impacts on public support in Switzerland but potentially deleterious effects on support in Canada, especially among Conservative voters.

Here, we focus on hunger reduction through international trade under alternative trade sce-narios for a wide range of climate futures. Under the current level of trade integration, climate change would lead to up to 55\u2009million people who are undernourished in 2050. Without adaptation through trade, the impacts of global climate change would increase to 73\u2009million people who are undernourished (+33%). Reduction in tariffs as well as institutional and infra-structural barriers would decrease the negative impact to 20\u2009million (\u221264%) people. We assess the adaptation effect of trade and climate-induced specialization patterns. The adaptation effect is strongest for hunger-affected import-dependent regions. However, in hunger-affected export-oriented regions, partial trade integration can lead to increased exports at the expense of domestic food availability. Although trade integration is a key component of adaptation, it needs sensitive implementation to benefit all regions.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 808}

Land-use change accounts for 6\u201317% of global carbon emis- sions1. At any reasonable carbon price, avoided deforestation pro- vides 7.2\u20139.6 times the abatement potential of reforestation2. There are a range of strategies for accomplishing this\u2014protected areas3, payments for ecosystem services4 and supply-chain initiatives5, among others. However, all of these strategies require monitoring of deforestation activities. Given that deforestation rates are often highest in low- and middle-income countries with limited resources to create effective monitoring systems6, the availability of low-cost monitoring technologies may be an important support to policy aimed at avoiding deforestation.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 822}

However, while freely available deforestation alerts on forest loss are available, the effect of these alerts and the presence of subscribers in a particu- lar area is unclear. Here, we show that subscriptions to alerts in 22 tropical countries decrease the probability of deforestation in Africa by 18% relative to the average 2011\u20132016 levels. There is no effect on other continents, and the availability of alerts does not significantly change deforestation outcomes. This decrease in Africa is higher in protected areas and concessions, suggesting that alerts either increased capacity to enforce existing deforestation policy or induced the development of more effective anti-deforestation policies. Calculated using the social cost of carbon for avoided deforestation in Africa, we estimate the alert system\u2019s value to be between US$149 million and US$696 million.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 823}

A potential response to this problem is the \u2018ramping-up principle\u2019, that is, the idea that the price of carbon should be gradually increased to give publics time to adjust to stricter regulations8. Although intuitively appealing, it is not clear whether publics do indeed prefer increasing cost paths over alternative cost schedules or whether they simply favour climate policies with average low costs. Previous work has explored the willingness of individuals to invest in energy efficiency improvements14,15 and public approval of costly climate policy initiatives16\u201320.

The sociode-mographic margins for the raw and weighted samples along with the population margins for each country are shown in Supplementary Table 1. We first studied support for different climate cost schedules using a direct question item to introduce the idea of an international agreement that would entail certain average costs per month and per household. The survey then presented respondents with four different ways to distribute the costs of implementing an international climate agreement over time and asked them to indicate which cost schedule they would select in a referendum given a certain cost level average (Fig. 1; see the Methods for the wording of the questions). The cost level was held constant for respondents in the United States, but we randomized whether the average monthly household costs for implementing the agreement were expected to be low (\u20ac28, \u20ac39 and \u00a315) or high (\u20ac113, \u20ac154 and \u00a360) in France, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Study Methods", "id": 843}

One intuitively appealing approach to this problem is to ramp up the costs of climate action over time. This lowers costs in the near to medium term but also requires individuals to keep adjusting to steadily increasing carbon prices. Our results indicate that such cost plans run the risk of reducing support for climate policies because many individuals prefer to smooth their consumption over time.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 848}

That heterogeneity in interests and capabilities has led many federal governments to encourage or tolerate large internal variations in policy effort. Diverse studies have pointed to the benefits of heterogeneous approaches for experimentation and learning1\u20134. Yet these realities in climate politics have not been well represented in leading modelling frameworks, which typically assume nationally uniform policy efforts5\u20138.

For example, the United States spends $7\u201310 billion dollars annually for the construction and renovation of stormwater systems, with larger expenditures needed over the long term21. With the generally poor state of aging infrastructure in the United States22, even moderate rainfall events (a return period of ~10 years)23,24 can exceed the capacity of drainage systems8. Although current inadequacies stem partly from outdated stormwater design standards25,26, we posit that it is also due to an insufficient understanding of \u2018flood connectivity\u2019 within urban landscapes, defined as a complex interplay of flooding mechanisms (Fig. 1) and drainage pathways within urban settings, arising from the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic head (the term used to describe the summed potential, kinetic and pressure energies of stormwater flows). This flood connectivity encompasses the interactions and interdependencies among runoff, surface and subterranean sewer and drainage systems, rivers and other natural and built water bodies, and infrastructure components (for example, buildings and roadways) that can, by design or in an unintended way, convey stormwater during floods.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 867}

In contrast, in the more realistic \u2018Integrated\u2019 case, if the water level in the channel exceeds the hydraulic head of the stormwater system at the outfall location, backwater flow will occur and water from the open channel will flow into the sewer system.

This could be seen in the evolution of the rule-making process with the addition of meetings with Boston residents and additional public comment periods as a result of requests from the CAG and regulated parties. Contestations were also reflected in the final rule-making language, which was drafted and revised to resonate with multiple, and sometimes conflicting, justice ideals that were mobilized throughout the process (Fig. 4).\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 886}

Extant scholarship largely focuses on the deleterious health effects of restrictive state-level immigration policies (Hardy et al. 2012; Torche and Sirois 2019; Wang and Kaushal 2019; Young, Crookes, and Torres 2022) or on the health effects of states\u2019 immigration policy climate, a measure that captures a range of immigration-related policies enacted in a given state (Dondero and Altman 2020; Hatzenbuehler et al. 2017; Schut and Boen 2022; Stanhope et al. 2019; Sudhinaraset et al. 2021; Young et al. 2019). Among the studies that examine how specific state-level inclusive immigration policies impact health, the focus has primarily been on policies that extend access to public health insurance to immigrants (for notable exceptions, see Koball, Kirby, and Hartig 2022; Potochnick, May, and Flores 2019; Schut and Boen 2022). How non-health-related inclusive immigration policies shape the health and well-being of immigrants and their children remains far less clear. Additionally, to what extent individual inclusive policies can positively affect health independent of states\u2019 broader policy climate is also not well understood.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 911}

There is very little research on the topic, but one study by Rapp et al. (2022) found that higher state-level structural sexism is associated with decreased health care access and more barriers to affordability among women. No studies to date have examined the relationship between structural sexism and preventive care use and how it might differ among women and men.

To further aid in the interpretation of these results, we used our model to calculate the predicted probabilities of HPV testing among women across the range of sexism exposures observed in our sample: A woman exposed to the lowest observed level of sexism has a .51 predicted probability of testing for HPV, while a woman exposed to the highest level of sexism has only a .38 predicted probability of testing for HPV.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 943}

The SES\u2013mental health association is also one of the most consistent in social science (Thoits 2010), spanning over a century of research (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend 1969; Faris and Dunham 1939; Hollingshead and Redlich 1958; Jarvis 1855; Srole et al. 1962) and continuing to the present day (Miech and Shanahan 2000; Warren 2009). This consistency within countries, predominantly estimated in the North American context, supports a social causation interpretation, net of social selection (Warren 2009; Wheaton 1978), indicating SES as a primary social determinant of mental health. However, cross-national comparisons across countries demonstrate that the strength of the association between SES indicators, such as education, occupation, and income, and mental health outcomes differs (Rai et al. 2013), implying contextual social determinants may be driving differences in the effect of SES between countries while also demonstrating the generality of the existence of this association across very different national contexts (Pr\u00e4g, Mills, and Wittek 2016).\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 984}

We use the case of abortion in Ohio, a state with one of the most restrictive legislative contexts in the United States prior to the overturning of Roe (Guttmacher Institute 2018), to show how the political context of care produces uncertainty. The political context of care includes (1) cultural politicization, such as stigma; (2) the legal, regulatory, and policy contexts; and (3) the economic organization of health care. We focus on how an influx of laws and regulations that are often unclear and incongruent with evidence-based medicine necessitate and complicate the interpretive work of institutions and providers. Frequent policy changes disrupt standards and practices, economic and legal penalties stigmatize abortion care, and variation in policies across institutions and states limits information seeking to address uncertainty.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 999}

Recent research suggests that the postpartum period is a particularly vulnerable time for women with opioid use disorders when rates of fatal overdose significantly increase (Schiff et al. 2018).

We focus only on the Phase 1A and 1B periods to examine who got early access while vaccine supply and eligibility were still limited. Obviously, many considerations are at play for how any individual can get the vaccine, and early media reports indicate that access to reliable Internet and transportation play a major role in people\u2019s ability to find an appropriate appointment time and travel to the location (Menchaca and Agnew 2021; Prescott and Prescott 2021; Stone 2021). Here, we focus on the structural element of this story to examine where these vaccine allocations went and whether certain types of neighborhoods were advantaged or disadvantaged in the rollout. We ask: What neighborhood characteristics are related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines? Specifically, are racial-ethnic minority communities less likely to have vaccine supply? Furthermore, how do these patterns relate to extant inequalities in health care provision?\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 1044}

The index is called GrimAge\u2014after the Grim Reaper\u2014because an accelerated score is grim news. This measure of aging has been shown to be a more robust predictor of morbidity and mortality among different racial groups than other epigenetic clocks currently available (Lu et al. 2019; McCrory et al. 2021). The index was developed by identifying a set of plasma protein predictors of mortality and then using these protein predictors to identify CpG sites that could predict time to death. As expected, the GrimAge index has a weak to moderate correlation with chronological age in the FACHS sample (r = .22), indicating a discrepancy between biological and calendar ages.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Study Methods", "id": 1097}

Given that respondents were not randomly assigned to incarceration, we then estimate the analysis using an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) scheme to adjust for possible threats of selection bias. For the IPTW procedures, we first created propensity scores by calculating the probabilities of incarceration conditional on our confounds (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). We then reran our regression analysis weighted by the propensity scores. By doing so, the IPTW method balances the distribution of confounds across the treated and untreated groups and allows for less biased estimates of the potential causal effect of incarceration (Robins, Hern\u00e1n, and Brumback 2000).\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Study Methods", "id": 1098}

Regardless, the primary results reported in this study appear to be more robust compared to alternative specifications and both opioid prescription rates and the income share of the bottom 20% of earners are drivers of the drug overdose epidemic.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Scientific Research Findings", "id": 1133}

Our emphasis on the role of income inequality in the current drug overdose epidemic is consistent with recent research demonstrating that growing income inequality is a key determinant of other health-related outcomes, including overall life expectancy, crime, and mental illness as well as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change and exacerbate air pollution\u2019s impact on public health (Hill, Jorgenson et al. 2019; Hill and Jorgenson 2018; Jorgenson et al. 2016, 2017, 2020). Therefore, addressing the supply side of the drug overdose epidemic is certainly warranted, but taking a more structural perspective to the epidemic that involves reducing income inequality would likely not only lead to reduced drug-related mortality but also have positive economic and environmental benefits.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Implications", "id": 1141}

In industrial societies, demographic, economic, and cultural transformations have made employment trajectories unpredictable, with critical factors such as occupational stress (Chandola et al. 2007), resource accumulation (Lantz et al. 2005; Read, Grundy, and Foverskov 2016), and social network development (Grundy and Sloggett 2003) impacting mental health.\n\nCategory:", "answer": "Policy Problem", "id": 1165}
