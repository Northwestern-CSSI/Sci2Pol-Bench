Second, a range of studies have demonstrated how individuals display more-positive attitudes towards policies directed towards industry rather than towards themselves, in much the same way as people in general tend to prefer less-stringent policies over more-coercive ones.\n    B. As such, we hypothesize that people dislike policies that imply direct personal costs more than policies aimed towards industry, even if these might indirectly affect consumer prices, and that public acceptance of removing fossil fuel subsidies for private consumption therefore is lower than for those for industrial use.\n    C.

The simulation results indicate that China experienced the most substantial increase in emissions in absolute terms, with emissions rising by 0.7%.\n\n    Answer with a permutation of A, B, and C that best restores the original paragraph (e.g., BAC, CAB). **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**\n    ", "answer": "ABC", "id": 252}
{"query": "You are given three shuffled sentences that originally formed a coherent paragraph from a scientific research paper. Your task is to determine the correct order by selecting the most logical and coherent sequence.\n\n    Shuffled Sentences:\n    A. To estimate the CDR gap, we first organize our analysis around two categories of CDR that differ in terms of scale, technology readiness and permanence: 'conventional CDR on land' and 'novel CDR'.\n    B. The former consists of methods conventionally defined as removals in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector (for example, afforestation, restoration).\n    C. Novel CDR comprises all other CDR methods, such as biochar, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) or bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS).\n\n    Answer with a permutation of A, B, and C that best restores the original paragraph (e.g., BAC, CAB). **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**\n    ", "answer": "ABC", "id": 253}

Based on DARPA's long track record of accomplishments, this funding model was expected to produce breakthrough innovations with the potential to transform the energy market.\n    B. ARPA-E was designed in the model of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), with expert programme staff who are hired on short-term rotation and empowered to craft solicitations in an area of technical need, select proposals and actively manage projects.\n    C. Even though the positive effect of public R&D grants to companies has been highlighted in recent studies, we still know little about how specific government R&D programmes impact cleantech innovation\u2014especially programmes that provide more than just the financial resources, such as R&D grants and tax credits, offered by traditional subsidy programmes.\n\n    Answer with a permutation of A, B, and C that best restores the original paragraph (e.g., BAC, CAB). **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**\n    ", "answer": "CBA", "id": 254}
