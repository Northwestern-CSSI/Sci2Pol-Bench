Particularly for buildings, indirect emissions remain high in the near term due to limited supply-side decarbonization and the sector's heavy reliance on electricity. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. In contrast, the transport sector has a considerably larger share of fossil fuel use, which offers greater potential for emissions reductions through electrification, as there is more opportunity to replace fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives.\nB. In light of increasing electricity demand, it is critical to expand the capacity of the energy supply sector while simultaneously decarbonizing it, as previous research has already suggested.\nC. Our scenarios show that integrating electrification with other demand-side strategies (ALL) can facilitate necessary transitions, potentially decreasing global electricity demand by 10 to 39 EJ per year, even under a 1.5 \u00b0C climate target.\nD. Depending on the model and climate policy, this reduction represents 8 to 33% of the electricity demand for transport and buildings.\nE.

At the same time, the use of traditional fuels, which are still commonly used for cooking in certain areas (predominantly in Africa), decreases substantially until 2050.\nB. In transport, per capita energy demand reduces in some regions, despite rising demand for mobility, due to increased use of electric vehicles with much higher efficiency than internal combustion engine vehicles.\nC. In contrast to the global results, some models signal that emissions from buildings could be higher in ACT and TEC, probably due to rebound effects. This is particularly noticeable in India, other Asian and Africa and Middle East.\nD.

This enables a sector-coupled analysis of biomass usage for energy across all sectors and of interactions with competing fuel options that can be produced from VRE sources, such as hydrogen and electrofuels. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. However these models usually include a restricted selection of biomass applications and, in contrast to IAMs, only a few studies based on sector-coupled ESMs have focused explicitly on biomass, bioenergy and/or BECC, and a thorough assessment of biomass usage including BECCUS across usage options is still lacking.\nB.

If BECC is removed, biomass can be excluded within a 6% cost increase, substantially less than with BECC. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Capturing biogenic CO2 emissions enhances carbon utilization, enabling scarce renewable carbon to be used multiple times and to provide negative emissions.\nB. When a higher carbon sequestration allowance permits a larger amount of fossil fuels to be offset by the sequestration of biogenic CO2, the value of the biogenic carbon is up to two times higher.\nC.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    Corporate investors are differentiated from public grants and other private investors in a few key ways. First, they consistently increased in number of investments and amount invested since 2005, even as public grants and other investors saw uneven spates of growth and decline, followed by continuous growth since 2016. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Second, corporate investment deals peak later in the startup life cycle and skew towards high-value growth equity and late-stage rounds rather than cheaper seed rounds (42.0% of corporate invest- ment deals are for growth equity, compared with 28.6% for other private investment).\nB. Climate-tech startups are active in multiple sectors, and the patterns of how different groups of investors engage with these sectors demonstrate their varying priorities.\nC. Public grants are most dominant in sectors with very few startups, with the six sec- tors with the highest percentage of public funding all including fewer than 60 startups (compared with an average of 145).\nD. In each of these sectors, public grants account for at least 24% of investments (compared with 11% of investments overall).\nE.

First of all, one can see between period (1) and period (2), when the MSR reform was negotiated and implemented, actors presumably started to look further into the future. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. When turning to period (1) before 2018, one notices that observed ETS prices are closer to the modelled prices for myopic actors than to the modelled prices for farsighted actors.\nB. Secondly, Fig. 3 shows that the 'Fit for 55' package sharply increases the stringency of the EU ETS.\nC. Optimal carbon prices (that is, obtained under the assumption of perfect foresight) to reach the new targets are substantially higher than those that were necessary for achieving previous goals.\nD. In fact, modelled prices for the 'Fit for 55' targets for 2020-2023 are in the order of \u20ac70-90 tCO2-1, corresponding well to observed 2021-2023 prices on the EU ETS, thus supporting the hypothesis that actors have transitioned towards a more farsighted perspective.\nE.

Any delay poses the risk of climate targets becoming out of reach or being reachable only at very high costs, as feasible roll-out rates can be limited, for example, due to the availability of skilled workers or production capacities. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Likewise, the required steeper carbon price in the long-term might increase the likelihood of a political backlash that dismantles the policy.\nB. To illustrate the delayed action, we focus on the electricity sector.\nC. The major problem we identify under the relapse to myopia is that, as seen in Fig. 7, delayed investments into wind capacity in turn delay the phase-out of coal power generation.\nD. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, our modelling shows that myopia could massively slow down wind capacity expansion in the next ten years, with yearly investments reduced by a factor of three, compared with the cost-optimal (that is, perfect foresight) trajectory.\nE.

For example, studies empha- sizing private passenger car electrification have shown that costs for key components such as batteries are expected to fall substantially and quickly, with increasing evidence that battery-electric vehicles will constitute the primary technology. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. However, electrifying heavy commercial trucks, such as US Class 7/8 or European N2/N3, still poses a tremendous challenge, particularly due to altered require- ments limiting the transferability of passenger car findings.\nB. The fast electrification of heavy road freight transport is pivotal in limiting global warming in line with the Paris Climate Agreement1-3.\nC. This follows since heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) contribute a noteworthy proportion of annual greenhouse gas emissions despite a low share in the vehicle stock.\nD. Whereas the European Union has agreed on ambitious tail-pipe emissions reduction targets for newly sold HDVs of -43% by 2030, -65% by 2035 and -90% by 2040 (compared with 2019/2020), California has effectively imposed the phase out of conventional combustion trucks by 20366, with other US states expected to follow.\nE.

In parallel, the underlying data and thus observed cost estimates implicitly assume a certain relevance of battery technology and fuel cells for future road freight transport or even other sectors. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. This relevance may be expressed as growing cumulative investments, economies of scale, supply chain improvements, spill-over effects and material or production improvements that would not occur without this relevance.\nB. To achieve battery system costs of approximately \u20ac2020150 kWh-1 as indicated by our regression to be achievable between 2028 (near market) and 2032 (scientific), cumulative production volumes must range from 1,300 GWh (near market) to 5,200 GWh (scientific).\nC. This yields short-term compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 39-49%.\nD. Those volumes may be feasible in the early 2030s if BETs take large market shares fast, given their head start in the early 2020s.

Our approach has two components and is summarized in Fig. 1. For all oil fields in California (Fig. 1a), we first construct an empirically estimated model of crude oil-well entry (Fig. 1b), production and exit at the oil-field level to project how various supply-side policies and macroeconomic conditions affect oil production across California oil fields out to 2045.\nD. In our second step, we insert field-level predictions of oil production from our empirical model into: (1) an air pollution model, InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution), to characterize how air pollution emissions from oil fields disperse across the state and (2) an employment input-output model, IMPLAN, which uses fixed multipliers to quantify local employment changes in the oil-extraction sector ('direct'), in sectors that provide inputs to oil extraction ('indirect') and in sectors where these workers spend income ('induced').\nE.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    As an explicit aim of the tax cut is to shield consumers from increasing fuel costs, an alternative way to do so is to give general income transfers to people that correspond to the reduction in tax revenues that would result from a decreased fuel tax. From a welfare perspective, this is preferable since people can then choose how to use the money. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. To the extent that the tax cut is supposed to appease particular groups, it is also possible to direct the income transfers to these groups.\nB. Such options include giving money to all car owners (not based on their driving), giving money to particular regions where the population is more reliant on cars (for example, rural areas) or reimbursing the tax collected in a region or municipality to that same region or municipality.\nC. Another rationale to uphold fuel taxes is to internalize climate damages from fossil fuel use (that is, Pigouvian taxes).\nD. From the perspective of this Analysis, an additional effect of an income transfer is that a share smaller than one will be spent on fuel; hence, the increase in Russian oil profits will be smaller. How much smaller will be assessed quantitatively.\nE.

Wu et al. provide a power grid simulation to conduct a very detailed analysis of the 2021 event, and Doss-Gollin et al. have shown that lower temperatures than those in February 2021 have been observed in the past 71 years, and heating demand predicted from temperature data would also have been higher in the past, although the 2021 freeze event was comparably long. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. These previous studies indicate a striking gap between the occurrence probability of such an event, its large-scale economic and social cost and the lack of winterization efforts.\nB. However, none of these studies assessed whether the economic incentives for power companies to invest in winterization have been sufficient, when the 2021 event is put into a long-term climatic context.\nC. As winterization was not strongly enforced by regulation in Texas, power generators had to rely on the incentives provided by the energy-only market to arrive at investment decisions.\nD.

There is a paucity of studies analysing clean cooking scenarios, particularly at a global scale. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Existing studies that focus on cooking access scenarios are limited in their representation of multiple cooking fuel use (fuel stacking), population heterogeneity and affordability constraints, which are critical to understanding whether people will regularly use new fuels or stoves after they acquire them.\nB. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed that efforts to provide clean fuels and stoves have been lagging far behind those aimed at extending electricity access.\nC.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    These results provide initial, albeit weak, support for our conceptual framework. For high users, normative and injunctive feedbacks pull behaviour in the same direction, which results in a reduction in electricity almost twice as large as that in the average treatment effect. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. For low electricity users, conforming to the reference groups' behaviour motivates a consumption increase ('boomerang'), but the injunctive feedback included in the eHER counterbalances the negative effect of the descriptive feedback.\nB. The injunctive feedback therefore induces stronger behavioural reactions among high electricity users, who are also exposed to the supporting descriptive feedback, than that among low electricity users, for whom the two types of feedback are at odds.\nC. Although such an interpretation is only suggestive based on the evidence presented so far, it shows how established findings are consistent with our conceptual framework.\nD.

Few studies have examined LPG use after adoption, and most of these have focused on average cylinder refill rates. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Government records indicate that about one-quarter of PMUY beneficiaries purchased five or more refills each year, suggesting the use of LPG as their primary cooking fuel, while another one-quarter did not purchase any refills in the first year, suggesting sparing use.\nB. Adoption of a clean cooking fuel like LPG is a necessary first step in ensuring smoke-free kitchens and reducing the drudgery of biomass collection.\nC. However, both sustained use of cleaner fuels and cessation of solid fuel use are required to achieve the stated health outcomes of PMUY.\nD. Using panel data collected from the rural areas of six major energy access-deprived states in India in 2014-2015 and 2018, we assess the determinants of upward shifts in LPG use\u2014from use as a minority fuel for cooking only, to the primary fuel and then as the exclusive cooking fuel.\nE.

For larger commercial or multifamily buildings, several common ECMs, such as upgrading building controls and replacing lighting, are estimated to have payback periods of five years or less and, in many cases, less than one year. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Despite the apparent eco- nomic case for retrofits, adoption has been slow.\nB. Scholars have long theorized that the energy efficiency gap is due, at least in part, to information deficits.\nC. Three distinct types of deficits are believed to be at play.\nD. First, building owners may lack information about the energy performance of their buildings, which includes information about strategies to reduce consumption, and thus may not be knowledgeable about energy efficiency investment opportunities.\nE. Second, even where building owners are so informed, they may withhold relevant information from their tenants.

But analyses that focus on such changes largely ignore market fundamentals, which they represent by assuming that prices revert to a constant mean or follow a deterministic trend.\nB. Here, we identify the price effects of speculative bubbles and changes in market governance and property rights by defining regimes as two or more consecutive quarters when oil prices move away from the level implied by market fundamentals.\nC. To identify regimes, we start with a simple assumption: in a world without regimes, a stable long-run cointegrating relation translates market fundamentals into an equilibrium price for oil.\nD.

Further, energy-vulnerable groups face energy injustices: procedural injustice in limited access to information, policy participation and legal rights; distributional injustice in inequalities in income, energy prices and housing efficiency; and injustice in recognition, which is a lack of recognition of the differential needs of energy vulnerable groups, and an unequal accordance of respect.\nC. Walker and Day14 provide in-depth discussions of these topics.\nD. Below, we draw on energy poverty and energy justice literature to define vulnerability indicators.\nE. Energy poverty can be considered a state of being in which households face an inability to meet both energy and other costs necessary to live a decent life.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 87}

The greater cost increases experienced by households vulnerable on the disability and elderly indicators assigned to TOU, relative to their non-vulnerable counterparts, suggest recognition injustices. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Cost increases faced by these households probably stem from inability to shift use times, as evidenced in our findings that households vulnerable on the disability indicator reduced on-peak use less than their non-vulnerable counterparts, and households vulnerable on both disability and elderly indicators reported less AC curtailment compared to their non-vulnerable counterparts.\nB. Households vulnerable on low-income and disability indicators face worse health and comfort outcomes than the outcomes faced by non-vulnerable counterparts, regardless of rate assignment, which probably stems from ongoing procedural and distributional injustices.\nC. The energy needs of those with disabilities vary greatly depending on the individual and disability, but are likely to involve a higher energy use.\nD. However, TOU appears to widen the difference in health outcomes between those vulnerable on the disability indicator and their non-vulnerable counterparts, which suggests recognition injustices given that this group already struggles to keep homes cool under current distributional injustices.\nE.

There are some meaningful differences across age groups not only absolutely but also proportionally, representing their differences in lifestyle choices and life stage. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. For residence, the young people have the highest carbon footprint (1.08 tCO2 per capita in 2017) and contribute to the largest share of total residence-related footprint (46%), the majority of which is from renting or purchasing a house and using electronic devices; the older people have the highest proportional share of residence-related carbon footprint (41%) as they might be accustomed to using traditional energy-intensive devices for heating and cooking (such as Kang and stove) and spend much of their time at home (and thus have large household energy consumption).\nB. For transport, the young people's transport-related footprint is the highest both absolutely (accounting for 50% of the total transport-related footprint by all groups) and proportionally (accounting for 25% of their own total footprint), largely from com- muting to work and from a few big trips each year (for example, from their workplace to their hometown).\nC. Moreover, the absolute and pro- portional per capita carbon footprints related to clothing, goods and transport have decreased gradually with age; however, health-related carbon footprint has increased with age, as has education-related carbon footprint until the individual is in their 30s to 40s, after which it decreases.\nD.

We use retirement age as the threshold to classify older people and assume that such a retirement delay policy affects only the population age structure.\nB. We find that the preceding two kinds of policies will both pose a challenge to carbon emissions mitigation.\nC. As for fertility policies, they affect the population mainly in terms of size and structure, and thus affect the carbon footprints.\nD. From 2017 to 2060, the total population will decrease from 1.40 billion to 1.15 billion (two-child policy), 1.30 billion (three-child policy) and 1.39 (replacement-level policy), which means the population differences are 12-20% under different policies.\nE.

Indeed, most countries include at least a qualitative description of how this type of mitigation effort would be achieved. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. However, only 40 countries have outlined scenarios in their long-term strategies that depict quantifiable levels of CDR by 2050.\nB. Our NDC assessment finds that countries' conventional CDR on land will change from -3.0 GtCO2 yr-1 for the period 2011-2020 (that is, the removals reported in GHG inventories once the indirect effects are factored out in this study) to approximately -3.1 GtCO2 yr-1 (unconditional pledges) or about -3.5 GtCO2 yr-1 (conditional pledges) in 2030.\nC. While some countries include novel CDR in their qualitative description of mitigation efforts towards the 2030 pledges and a few provide initial quantifications (for example, Korea, Canada, Norway), these are currently not possible to distinguish from avoided emissions (for example, fossil-based CCS).\nD.

We then provide an assessment of the implications of this observation for some key financial metrics of banks if they had to divest from high-carbon assets. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Specifically, we utilize the accounting relationships among some of these metrics to show that an active divestment from high-carbon assets could be costly for banks.\nB. We argue that this, in turn, could create perverse incentives impairing the shift of financial resources from high-carbon to low-carbon assets, possibly including much needed investments in renewable energy.\nC. Finally, we provide some possible explanations as to why some of these models may lead to estimates that are negatively correlated with carbon emissions.\nD.

As long as the structure of the regulation foresees that (1) losses are costs that are accounted for as expected costs as opposed to incurred costs and (2) provision coverage ratios are proportional to model-based estimates of risk, then divesting from an 'estimated' low-risk asset and re-investing in an 'estimated' high-risk asset mechanically leads to higher costs in the income statement. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Indeed, despite not being able to use carbon emissions data directly, in our Discussion and Methods, we provide strong evidence for a negative correlation between CPRS/emission intensity of assets and risk estimates.\nB. Once again, we find that our main results persist.\nC.

However, leaving this effort exclusively to the private sector could pose additional challenges.\nB. Once they mature, the cost-minimizing solution to incentivize NETs is deemed to be their integration into a single carbon market alongside traditional mitigation strategies such as renewables.\nC. In this paper, we point out that this 'first-best' setting could entail major drawbacks: if the carbon price is a tax from the perspective of carbon emitters, it would be seen as a subsidy for carbon removal companies.\nD. In 2022 alone, foundations linked to private donors such as Google and Facebook pledged almost US$1 billion to advance the research and development of negative emissions technologies (NETs).\nE.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    We find that the no overshoot scenario has higher inequality before net zero as emission reductions, which are regressive, are frontloaded. This increase is more accentuated for regions with high removal since more negative emissions are deployed in the 2030s and 2040s and these are financed with a higher carbon price. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. However, negative emissions are lower in the second half of the century if the budget is not overshot.\nB. Consequently, the inequality implications of negative emissions are reduced, especially for highly impacted countries (fourth bracket).\nC. Thus, promoting net-negative emissions by overshooting emissions and temperature leads to an intertemporal inequality trade-off between regressive mitigation in the short term and regressive NET ownership in the long term.\nD. For the countries that are more impacted by the inequality repercussions of negative emissions, Fig. 4 indicates that a smaller overshoot is preferable.\nE.

Future cost-effective climate change mitigation strategies often deploy bioenergy at large scales. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. The use of biofuels promises a low-carbon alternative to fossil-fuel-based liquids as well as the possibility to enable carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).\nB. The combined ability of biofuels to overcome and compensate for decarbonization bottlenecks is a major driver of its future large-scale deployment.\nC. However, the relevance of bioenergy as a means to climate change mitigation is also controversially discussed,since its production will be in competition with other land-use (LU) activities and will thus increase the already existing pressure on land systems, affecting biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, freshwater use andfoodprices.\nD.

We find that irrespective of the policy design-a large fraction of LUC emissions does not originate from the sites of bioenergy cultivation but occurs indirectly at formerly forested areas or pasture, where agricultural activity displaced by bioenergy production is moved. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Those ILUC emissions as well as bioenergy plantations directly replacing carbon-rich ecosystems contribute to high EFs (for example, in the northern regions of South America for noLUreg).\nB. Without LU policies globally, more than 85% of the additional emissions induced by bioenergy production originate from territories that together generate less than 16% of total biomass production.\nC. By contrast, the main part of the bioenergy (more than three quarters across all policy settings) is being produced with a direct 80-year EF of less than 37 kg CO2 GJbiofuel-1 (half the EF of diesel), directly causing less than 10% of the total bioenergy-induced emissions if LU regulation policies are absent.\nD. Therefore, by only accounting for direct LUC emissions within major bioenergy-producing regions, only a small fraction of attached emissions can be traced.\nE.

In its simplest form, net zero involves balancing some amount of remaining emissions with an equal amount of negative emissions through carbon dioxide removal. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. This idea of achieving a 'balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks' was enshrined in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement and has become a prominent feature of recent IPCC assessments as well as country strategies.\nB.

However, and repeatedly recognized during both the 26th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP26) meeting in Glasgow and the recently finalized COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, many countries currently have policies that keep end-user prices artificially low through subsidies.\nB.

As such, we hypothesize that people dislike policies that imply direct personal costs more than policies aimed towards industry, even if these might indirectly affect consumer prices, and that public acceptance of removing fossil fuel subsidies for private consumption therefore is lower than for those for industrial use.\nB. In our survey, the respondents were also asked about their social and economic characteristics, whether they own a fossil fuelled vehicle and their views regarding various climate change scenarios.\nC.

By contrast, in the pathways with NDC++ emission level in 2030, the number of years of overshoot reduces to 58, 56 and 47 years respectively.\nB. Advancing the timing of net-zero pledges can be an important ratcheting strategy as it could provide the extra push required in the long-term to return 2100 warming to <1.5 \u00b0C and further reduce temperature overshooting.\nC. For example, in the pathway with NDC+ emissions in 2030 followed by a 5% minimum decarbonization rate and net-zero pledges in the specified target years, the 2100 and peak temperature changes are, respectively, 1.51 \u00b0C and 1.72 \u00b0C.\nD.

For countries with net-zero pledges (for example, China, India and the USA), cumulative emissions grow and then remain flat beyond the year of net-zero under the pathway with central assumptions. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. For such countries, ratcheting ambition in the near-term\u2014as in the NDC++ pathways\u2014results in slower growth of emissions and a plateauing of emissions at a lower peak level.\nB. In addition, ratcheting ambition in the near-term for such countries also facilitates an advancement of the timing of net-zero CO2 emissions.\nC. This advancement occurs despite the target years for the official net-zero pledges\u2014which are modelled in terms of net-zero GHG emissions for the above countries\u2014remaining unchanged (see Methods and Supplementary Table 2 for details on how net-zero pledges are modelled) because it facilitates a more rapid phase out of fossil-fuel-based infrastructure.\nD.

This implies that (on average) the NFIP is currently underpricing these regions. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Conversely, coastal regions display an increase from 10.2% to 17.1% in penetration rates due to more attractive premiums under risk-based insurance pricing for a share of households due to spatial variation in premiums.\nB.

Importantly, it was necessary that all companies in our sample reported their past emissions using both market- and location-based emission accounting methods.\nB. Although empirical evidence is still needed, we have adopted here the common assumption that PPAs do lead to additional renewable energy production and real emission reductions, as the long-term power price de-risks new projects and allows access to project finance.\nC. By contrast, we assume that RECs and similar market-based instruments are non-additional, that is, not leading to additional renewable genera- tion capacity or real emissions reductions, and we use the term RECs to refer to all non-PPA instruments for that reason.\nD. Although existing literature suggest that RECs are non-additional due to their low and uncertain prices11\u201318, some claim that RECs may still contribute to the generation of more renewable energy in the longer term by, in aggregation, signaling to the market that there is a demand for renewable energy.\nE.

By contrast, the increase in energy consumption had a net-positive contribution to the change in emissions. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Hence, the appearance that the combined historical scope 2 emission trajectory of companies with SBTs easily aligned with the 1.5 \u00b0C goal is strongly misleading and a consequence of heavy reliance on RECs, which are not associated with real emission reductions.\nB. Reported location-based emissions reduced from 77.1 to 69.2MtCO2e per year (10.3%) over the period, far less than the reported market-based emissions.\nC. This is as RECs and PPAs are not considered in location-based accounting (Box 1), which is also why location-based emissions were higher than market-based emissions in 2015.\nD. Instead, decarbonization of the electricity grid was the main contributor to the reported emis- sion reduction, with the increase in energy consumption again having a net-positive contribution to the change in emissions.\nE.

A large literature has now investigated the implications of these 'revenue recycling' opportunities and identified an equal per capita refund of the revenues as a salient option. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A.

Across the RCP8.5 scenarios, projections for the baseline trade scenario range from an increase of 13-181% and 2-51% in the population at risk of hunger for SAS and SSA, respectively. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. The effect of the trade scenarios on regional undernourishment is largest among baseline net-importing regions (SSA, MNA, EAS and SAS) and regions in which climate change reduces net exports.\nB. The fixed imports scenario enlarges hunger impacts in the extreme climate change scenario in SSA, SAS and SEA by raising agricultural prices (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), increasing net exports in SEA, and reducing net imports in SSA and SAS.\nC. Adverse effects from trade restriction, such as the export bans observed during the 2007-2008 world food crisis28,29 and those feared as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, may pose severe hunger risks under climate change.\nD.

The system that we examine is the first to offer loss alerts at high spatial resolution (-30 m) and frequency (up to every 8 days, depending on cloud cover). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. The GLAD alerts use all available Earth observation data from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites, which combined have a revisit rate of 8 days.\nB.

In this case, the counterfactual is countries that received alerts later. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. If it were the case that forests with higher deforestation rates received alerts sooner than forests with lower rates, and if those rates continued to be the same over time, then even in the absence of an effect of alerts, the estimated impact (approximately the deforestation rate of early recipients minus that of late recipients) would show that the availability of alerts had increased deforestation.\nB. In this case, the comparison we make would understate the impact of alert availability.\nC. The reverse is true if forests at low risk of deforestation receive alerts first.\nD. Tests of differences in deforestation rates between late- and early-enrolled countries before 2016 suggest that the former provide a plausible counterfactual for the latter, as there are no significant differences in deforestation in this pre-alert period.\nE.

If an area of forest is cleared and there are clouds overhead when the satellite images the area, it will not be detected. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. As images can only be obtained every 8 days, a month or more may pass before an image without clouds blocking the clearing can be obtained, particularly during rainy seasons or in regions with persistent cloud cover.\nB. This means that there can be a time lag between the clearing event and the actual alert publication, so interventions to stop further deforestation may also be delayed.\nC. This affects their utility, but it does not affect our impact estimates as we do not directly include the alerts in our estimation.\nD. The fact that we detect an impact suggests that even this imperfect measure provides additional important information to control deforestation.\nE.

The sociodemographic margins for the raw and weighted samples along with the population margins for each country are shown in Supplementary Table 1. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. We first studied support for different climate cost schedules using a direct question item to introduce the idea of an international agreement that would entail certain average costs per month and per household.\nB. The cost level was held constant for respondents in the United States, but we randomized whether the average monthly household costs for implementing the agreement were expected to be low (\u20ac28, \u20ac39 and \u00a315) or high (\u20ac113, \u20ac154 and \u00a360) in France, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively.\nC. These values have been used in previous research and correspond to approximately 0.5% and 2.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) expressed in average monthly costs per household.\nD.

Moving from an increasing to a constant cost path caused a significant increase in policy support by 7 percentage points compared to the widely discussed option of ramping up costs over time (the reference category), even when we explicitly specified and fixed the cost level of the policy proposal. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. At the same time, decreasing cost schedules also raised climate policy support compared to the increasing cost path.\nB. We also note that the causal effect estimates are a function of both the preference for a policy feature and the intensity of that preference, which contrasts to the analysis above in which the estimates are simply a function of the number of individuals who prefer a given cost schedule.\nC. Understanding the rationale for the positive estimate of the decreasing cost path in the conjoint experiment seems a productive inquiry for future research, but we focus primarily on the comparison between constant costs and increasing costs in the remainder of this paper because constant costs are preferred to an increasing time path across both measurement strategies.\nD. To put the sensitivity to cost paths into perspective, we also visualized the causal effects of cost levels with support for climate action.\nE.

One intuitively appealing approach to this problem is to ramp up the costs of climate action over time. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. This lowers costs in the near to medium term but also requires individuals to keep adjusting to steadily increasing carbon prices.\nB. Our results indicate that such cost plans run the risk of reducing support for climate policies because many individuals prefer to smooth their consumption over time.\nC. The ramping-up approach could remain politically feasible if some voters focus on near-term costs or if policy experience causes mass preferences to become more favourable towards costly climate action in general.\nD. Similarly, respondents who were more patient were significantly more likely to support a constant climate cost schedule over time-varying cost paths such as the ramping-up approach.\nE. Overall, the predictive patterns indicate that, consistent with the results from our analysis of respondents' answers to our open-ended question, general attitudes towards time seem to play a systematic role in understanding mass preferences for constant over dynamic cost paths.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 179}

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    We categorize states into three groups, namely low-, medium-, and high-supporting states, depending on the level of current public support for climate policy. With the Uniform approach, the carbon price is uniform across the three groups of states, but increases dramatically as the national mitigation efforts become more stringent (solid lines in Fig. 3: US$74, US$210, US$670 and US$1,557 per ton CO2 for national targets of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% decarbonization, respectively). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. The substantial increase in carbon price is a direct result of an increasing MAC, which suggests that availability of low-cost mitigation options becomes increasingly constrained to achieve more ambitious decarbonization goals.\nB. Compared with the Uniform approach, the main effect of intro- ducing heterogeneous subnational policies is to shift the burden of emissions reductions from low- to medium- and high-supporting states, while the country overall still achieves the same national mitigation target.\nC. The effect of such a shift is driven by much lower carbon prices in the low-supporting states and is greatest under the Heterogeneous approach, since it displays the widest heterogeneity in state-level effort.\nD. We are mindful that state and federal policies arise through much more complex and nuanced processes; our purpose here is simply to show a plausible method for quantifying degrees of heterogeneity and their implications for mitigation cost (see Sensitivity analysis section for alternative formulations for policy heterogeneity).\nE.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    We also consider three technology constraints based on what prior research has shown to be most pivotal in determining future mitigation costs. For all three policy approaches, we find much higher mitigation costs under: (a) limited electricity infrastructure investment and production, (b) no investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and (c) limited availability of biomass. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. The greatest impacts on mitigation costs come from constraining CCS and biomass because this restricts the role of BECCS and forces greater reliance upon extremely expensive technologies outside the electricity and refinery sectors, such as hydrogen use in transport and industrial sectors.\nB. Relaxing the bio- mass constraint, by contrast, significantly lowers the mitigation costs (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12). Limiting electricity production has a lesser impact on overall costs because, in the face of such con- straints, reductions in energy demand through efficiency measures, increases in natural gas use coupled with CCS, as well as more mitigation in the refinery sector through BECCS, can provide additional decarbonization.\nC. Detailed discussions are included in Supplementary Note 3.\nD. Although these technology constraints raise the total national cost of mitigation, our main finding remains robust: a heteroge- neous policy approach, relative to a uniform approach, is only slightly more expensive.\nE.

Among the studies that examine how specific state-level inclusive immigration policies impact health, the focus has primarily been on policies that extend access to public health insurance to immigrants (for notable exceptions, see Koball, Kirby, and Hartig 2022; Potochnick, May, and Flores 2019; Schut and Boen 2022). How non- health-related inclusive immigration policies shape the health and well-being of immigrants and their children remains far less clear.\nD. Additionally, to what extent individual inclusive policies can positively affect health independent of states' broader policy climate is also not well understood.\nE. The present study expands understanding of the links between state immigration policies and health by leveraging 14 years of data from the U.S. natality files to assess how state laws that authorize undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses are associated over time with key indicators of perinatal health\u2014early entry into prenatal care, gestational age at delivery, and birthweight- among Mexican and Central American immigrants.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 192}

Over the past two decades, deportations from the United States have reached record levels, and anti-immigrant rhetoric has intensified (Callaghan et al. 2019; Golash-Boza 2015). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Many states have simultaneously passed laws that intensify surveillance and immigration enforcement (Young and Wallace 2019).\nB. Within this context, we find that states' move to extend access to a driver's license to undocumented immigrants is associated with improvements in low birthweight and mean birthweight for Mexican and Central American immigrants.\nC. We further find no association between these laws and birthweight among U.S.-born non- Hispanic White birthing people\u2014a group for whom no effect from the law was expected.\nD. Given that birthweight is a critical measures of early development (Torche and Conley 2015), this study's findings underscore how states' extension of legal rights to immigrants can improve the health of the next generation.\nE.

Whereas one third of pri- vate sector workers were union members in the 1950s, today, about 6% of the private sector is unionized. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Although most research on the consequences of union decline focuses on its economic impact, a growing literature has addressed the consequences of union membership for health and wellbeing (Leigh and Chakalov 2021; Reynolds and Brady 2012).\nB. The current study uses multilevel growth curve models applied to 39 waves of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics between years 1970 and 2019 to assess how the accumulated experience of union membership across the entirety of one's career, or what we term cumulative unionization, affects disparities of general health, functional limitations, and chronic conditions among adults ages 60 and older.\nC. The measure of cumulative unionization, rather than a static measure of union status collected at a particular point in time.\nD.

As a result, unionized workers can more easily devote contem- poraneous spending to health needs and have access to health care to address health issues. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Union members on average have higher rates of paid sick leave, vacation leave, and paid family leave, all of which should increase access to health care and recovery time away from work in the case of a negative health event.\nB. Union members are also more likely to have health insurance and higher quality health insurance (Hagedorn et al. 2016; Reynolds and Brady 2012), which may enable more immediate treatment of health problems and enable access to preventive care, which would reduce longer-term health problems.\nC. Union members typically have lower rates of excessive overtime work and less exposure to precarious and contingent work, which may reduce workplace stress.\nD. Unions provide an institutionalized platform for workers to organize collectively against unsafe conditions; the classic work by Wallace (1987) shows that higher union membership rate is associated with significant declines in fatal and nonfatal injury rates among miners.\nE. Unions also enhance social stability and support, promoting stable marriage (Schneider and Reich 2014), greater sociality and support at work (Hagedorn et al. 2016), and more frequent community and charity engagement (Zullo 2013).\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 196}

The principle of life-span development suggests that aging is a life-long process, dependent on circumstances and events throughout the life course (Elder et al. 2003). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. We therefore focus on growth trajectories of health outcomes and follow workers beyond the end of their careers.\nB. To the extent that career mechanisms influence older adulthood health, we anticipate that these will decay the further a respondent moves from their working ages because any effects of career mechanisms will mix with more immediate life course and health issues that arise in older adulthood.\nC. Moreover, the life course principle of time and place argues that the life course outcomes of individuals are embedded in and shaped by the historical times and places they experience over their lifetime (Elder et al. 2003).\nD. The diverse historical circumstances of individuals from different birth cohorts may matter significantly for their career decisions, opportunities, and experiences.\nE. Specifically, we are able to capture respondents who entered the labor market during the golden age of unionization (Cowie 2010) and the era of rapid union decline, led by the Carter and Reagan administrations, which diminished the support of federal institutions for labor (Jacobs and Myers 2014; Rosenfeld 2014).\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 197}

For example, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy screen- ings are important tools in reducing deaths from colorectal cancer (Brenner, Stock, and Hoffmeister 2014), flu shots decrease the risk of serious illness if infected (Ferdinands et al. 2021), and COVID-19 vaccinations prevented an estimated 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths worldwide during the first year of use (Watson et al. 2022). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. \u201cPreventive care\u201d generally includes spending on programs for public health information, education, and counseling; immunization, early disease detection, and healthy condition monitoring programs.\nB. Thus, understanding and addressing the determinants of preventive care use is critical to reducing preventable deaths, which are higher in the United States than all other OECD countries, and vital for improving population health (Kamal and Hudman 2020).\nC. A growing literature points to structural sexism as an important upstream driver of population health in the United States (Homan 2019, 2021a, 2021b; Kavanagh and Graham 2019; Krieger 2020).\nD. Structural sexism refers to systematic gender inequality in power and resources in a given social context (Homan 2019).\nE.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    Norms of femininity are largely framed in opposition to masculinity. Emphasized femininity is the complement to hegemonic masculinity and involves orienting one's behavior toward the interests and desires of men (Connell 1987). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Such femininity typically entails gentleness, nurturing, passivity, beauty, youth, fragility, and a domestic/family orientation.\nB. While there is much less research on femininity and health, positive health beliefs and behaviors, including health care use, are typically considered feminine-typed behavior (Courtenay 2000; Fleming and Agnew-Brune 2015).\nC. Additionally, the feminine ideals of youth, beauty, and nurturing may lead to increased contact with health care providers to obtain services for women themselves and their children (Daly and Groes 2017).\nD. In sum, to the extent that structural sexism increases pressure to conform to the hegemonic ideals of masculinity and emphasized femininity (Connell 1987, 2012), we would expect greater structural sexism to be associated with higher levels of preventive health care use among women and lower levels among men (see Figure 1a).\nE.

We used the former measure because the 2018 mammogram recommendations vary for women 40 years and older, and therefore, the latter measure may miss important variation by limit- ing the time period.\nD.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    Although there is little evidence of an indirect effect of income inequality on life expectancy through policy, this mediation model is theoretically viable because policy is known to shape the social, economic, and behavioral determinants of population health (Bambra, Smith, and Pearce 2019; Dawes 2020; Montez et al. 2017; Woolhandler et al. 2021). For example, U.S. state policy regulates access to human capital by funding schools, income by setting a minimum wage, prenatal care via Medicaid, childhood nutrition through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, tobacco by way of excise taxes, and much more. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. For these reasons, Bambra and colleagues (2019) aptly frame policies and the political choices behind them as the \u201ccauses of the causes of the causes\u201d of geographic inequalities in population health.\nB. While many studies have isolated the health benefits of specific policies, such as minimum wage (e.g., Kaufman et al. 2020), earned income tax credits (e.g., Strully, Rehkopf, and Xuan 2010), and Medicaid (e.g., Bhatt and Beck-Sagu\u00e9 2018), others have focused on the health consequences of overarching policy contexts (Beckfield and Bambra 2016; Bradley et al. 2016; Montez et al. 2020).\nC. For instance, lower life expectancies in the United States relative to other high-income countries are largely explained by the miserly social policies of the United States (Beckfield and Bambra 2016).\nD. Furthermore, U.S. states with a more liberal policy context have exhibited longer life expectancies over a 45-year period than states with more conservative policy contexts (Montez et al. 2020).\nE.

We then estimate how states' IOL trends are affected by changes in risk factors for \u201chigh-risk pregnancy\u201d among states' childbearing populations.\nB. Evidence suggests that increases in state IOL rates among pregnancies to White women were likely responding to changes in the demographic composition and changes in risk factors among states' White childbearing populations (e.g., increases in births to women with obesity and increases in the prevalence of maternal hypertension and maternal diabetes).\nC. By contrast, the increases in state IOL rates among pregnancies to Black and Latina women are not associated with changes in demographics or changes in risk factors among states' Black and Latina childbearing populations.\nD. Instead, we find evidence to suggest that increases in U.S. states' IOL rates among Black and Latina women were strongly shaped by changes in the demographics and risk factors of the states' White childbearing populations.\nE. Taken together, our findings suggest a clear example in which U.S. obstetric care is not being centered at the margins (Hardeman et al. 2016) given that the rising IOL rates among all three racial-ethnic groups appear to be responding only to changes in risk factors among states' White childbearing populations.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 204}

Labor induction is an important obstetric intervention for minimizing risks to maternal and fetal health, and increases in IOL have also come on the heels of efforts to reduce cesarean deliveries (Nicholson et al. 2004, 2009a, 2009b; Nicholson, Yeager, and Macones 2007).\nB. Indeed, scholars and practitioners use the term \u201cpreventative labor induction\u201d when considering how elective IOL might be used to reduce risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth (Caughey 2009; Caughey et al. 2009; robman et al. 2018; Nicholson et al. 2008).\nC. However, IOL is often overused in the United States, as evidenced by research suggesting that two-thirds of the increase in IOL during the 1990s was a result of \u201cnonmedically indicated\u201d inductions (Ramsey, Ramin, and Ramin 2000), and gestational distributions of U.S. births have been dramatically changed by the increasing use of IOL at select gestations (Tilstra and Masters 2020).\nD.

Pregnant substance users are uniquely exposed to competing medical and legal responses while receiving pregnancy-related health care. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Despite recent, louder prescriptions to treat addiction as a disease (Pew Research Center 2014), pregnant and postpartum substance users continue to experience extraclinical interventions such as criminal prosecution and child welfare interventions (Paltrow and Flavin 2013).\nB. State mandatory reporting laws and child abuse statutes that codify substance use during pregnancy as child maltreatment create a statutory environment that empowers practitioners to investigate their patients for suspected illegal activity.\nC. Recent estimates indicate that tens of thousands of women a year are subject to child welfare investigations after medical staff identify and report them to the state for prenatal substance use (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2021).\nD. Expanding current understandings of the relationship between medicalization and criminalization processes, this study reveals the mechanisms that enable medical providers to engage in investigatory work in the clinic. I also discuss the consequences of medico-legal hybridity, whereby criminal-legal logics get taken up in medical practice in such a way that medical routines, practices, and interactions become a form of criminalization.\nE.

The penetration of law into medicine is uneven and contingent on institutional arrangements and professional prerogatives (Heimer 1999). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. There are myriad reasons that clinicians may be reluctant to report suspected child abuse, including a lack of knowledge of state laws, concerns about patient retention, and previous poor interactions with child protective services.\nB. On the other hand, maternal and newborn care providers may be particularly receptive to prenatal drug use laws and perceive the state as a useful partner in managing \u201cdifficult\u201d patients (Abel and Kruger 2002; Heimer 1999).\nC. Law empowers and informs medical practices, but it is not wholly determinative. In most setings (barring settings with universal testing protocol), provider discretion determines whether patients will be tested and reported to the state.\nD. The state of Illinois, where this study was conducted, classifies evidence of a controlled substance in the blood, urine, or meconium (first stool) of a newborn infant as child neglect (Illinois Abused and Neglected Child Act 1975).\nE.

Through what Foucault (1991) termed governmentality, policies may induce institutions to foster individual-level behavioral choices that cohere with the aims of the government. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Throughout the twentieth century, governmental policy regarding drug supply increasingly focused on the criminal justice system (MacCoun and Reuter 2001).\nB. By relying on policies that define certain drugs as illicit, there is a natural reliance by the state on the criminal justice system to curb supply.\nC. Surveillance systems that induce self-governing behavior rather than direct coercion are more efficient because they reduce the resources required to align behavior with governmental aims (Foucault 1995).\nD. In this regard, coercion may occur not only through explicit mandates but also in implicit forms that give the appearance of choice as well.\nE.

Within the United States, drug policies operate in a multilevel manner. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Whereas federal-level policies intervene on the international drug trade, including heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, PDMPs represent actions taken at the U.S. state level to curb pharmaceutical drugs acquired within the context of the medical system.\nB. Although modest within the larger umbrella of U.S. drug control, PDMPs nonetheless directly target medicalized substances recognized as fueling the overdose crisis.\nC. Evaluation of such policies and the distinctions in how they are implemented remains imperative to identify efficacious solutions to reduce overdose mortality and other substance abuse problems.\nD. We focus on the implementation of PDMPs\u2014given their role in surveillance, long history, wide coverage, and application to several classes of substances (Gugelmann and Perrone 2011)\u2014in shifting overdose mortality while accounting for the broader policy context by considering the passage of other relevant policies over the period of observation.\nE.

Other policies enacted, such as enhanced naloxone access and Good Samaritan laws, require individual-level action, which may depend on varying individual and community resources, and are not subject to the same level of governmental oversight in their use. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. In some ways, these policies release a certain level of governmental control.\nB. By absolving users of responsibility should they call state actors such as first responders, Good Samaritan laws prevent scrutiny by the criminal justice system (Haegerich et al. 2014)\u2014albeit in ways that may yield better mortality outcomes.\nC. By reducing the need for hospital admission after use of an overdose reversal drug, naloxone access laws (Davis and Carr 2017) curtail surveillance by the health system.\nD. Notably, these policies create a mechanism whereby the state can intervene only on adverse outcomes rather than patterns of drug consumption more generally.\nE.

Moreover, this impact has not been equally shared. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Some people, because of existing social and economic resources, have been better able to shield themselves from transmission of the disease and the various negative consequences reverberating from the pandemic.\nB. In particular, Black, Latino, and Native American populations in the United States have experienced higher rates of infection and, when infected, have been more likely to experience severe disease and death (Millett et al. 2020; Peek et al. 2021; Ramos and Zamudio 2020).\nC.

In this analysis, we aim to extend this literature to examine how this lack of adequate health care provision relates to the COVID-19 pandemic and the early rollout of the vaccine. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. There may be myriad reasons that affect where and how people choose to procure provider services, with physical proximity/convenience being only one of them that may be important to people of limited means, who lack of access to transportation or are elderly/homebound and may find travel difficult.\nB. Distance from providers does not create an impenetrable barrier to access (in this case, vaccine access), but it can increase the \u201cfriction of distance,\u201d which may be difficult to over- come absent other kinds of individual or household resources (Tobler 1970).\nC. Therefore, with this analysis, we are not assuming that people can only or will only seek vaccine access within their local communities but, rather, that having access in close proximity would facilitate their ability to get it, especially for those who are more vulnerable.\nD. Some limited work has also linked the distribution of health care locations to health and health care outcomes.\nE.

Since the first shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 14, 2020, the state of Texas has released information on a weekly basis on the location and quantity of doses allocated across the state by county.\nB. We collected these data each week for the first 10 weeks of the vaccine rollout (December 14, 2020, to February 15, 2021).\nC. However, we decided to exclude the first week from our analysis because these allocations went only to major hospital sites and were exclusively distributed to first-tier health care workers under Texas's Phase 1A of the vaccine distribution.\nD. We chose these weeks for several reasons. We wanted to focus on the early vaccine rollout when supplies were limited and access was difficult to examine which areas got early access to this privilege.\nE. In the subsequent week (Week 11 of the rollout), most of the state of Texas experienced a catastrophic winter storm that affected vaccine distributions both in terms of the ability to make shipments to vaccine sites and the ability to keep those doses properly chilled because of widespread power outages.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 221}

Education has been associated with assorted morbidities, mortality risk, disability, general health, mental health, and an array of health-related behaviors linked to various health outcomes (Adams 2002; Arendt 2005; Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010; Lleras-Muney 2005; Turner and Lloyd 1999). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. One important question about the links between education and health that remains unanswered, however, is whether these links are robust for individuals who pursued schooling at a stage of the life course when education has normatively been completed (as reflected in formal definitions of nontraditional students, as well as institutional expectations and structures): prior to having children (Macmillan 2005; Marini1984).\nB. This question is also relevant to current public health policy given that scholars from across disciplines have argued that one of the most powerful policy levers for reducing population-level health disparities is promoting higher education (Frieden 2010; Hahn and Truman 2015).\nC. It remains unknown, however, whether promoting mothers' school reentry can remediate these issues.\nD. This uncertainty is further underscored by a key tenet of the life course perspective (Elder 1984), which suggests that out-of-sequence life course progressions can create challenges and conditions that undermine the efficacy of individuals in their roles and statuses (Pearlin et al. 2005) and reduce the rewards and resources that such roles and statues are supposed to generate (Furstenberg 2005; also see Hogan 1978 for a key theoretical contribution).\nE. Thus, this question also raises the broader theoretical issue of whether out-of-sequence schooling creates challenges that diminish the well-documented returns to higher education (e.g., better labor market opportunities, wider social networks, increased cog- nitive skills; Mirowsky and Ross 2003; Zajacova and Lawrence 2018) for women with children.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 222}

The first are demographic factors. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Increases in mothers' labor force participation, decreases in men's labor force participation, and changes in family structure, including the rise in nonmarital fertility and greater union instability, have brought about a rise in the share of women who are unmarried parents and the sole or primary breadwinners (Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie 2006).\nB. Thus, greater education is also needed for women to access stable work and adequate wages (Kalleberg 2011).\nC. Third, there has been an expansion of the higher education system\u2014which includes a rise in for-profit schools, which have targeted their recruitment efforts at lower-income mothers (Cottom 2017)\u2014as well as federal student aid programs over the past few decades.\nD. These factors have made it easier for adults with fewer resources (e.g., mothers with lower levels of education) to return to school (Rosenbaum 2001).\nE. Outside of these largescale factors, disadvantaged mothers, who are often their children's sole caregiver, also report returning to school in a renewed effort to improve their children's opportunities for mobility (Edin and Kefalas 2011; Katz 2013).\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 223}

Indeed, medical providers demonstrate bias on par with the general population, even among those who self-identify as holding nondiscriminatory beliefs (Burgess et al. 2007; van Ryn and Fu 2003; Zestcott, Blair, and Stone 2016). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A.

This possibility requires adjustments for preexisting confounds, including adverse child- hood experiences and childhood disadvantage, which are reliable determinants of adult morbidity and mortality (Miller et al. 2011).\nC. Due to preexisting tendencies to have poor health and to engage in behaviors that result in confinement, it is also necessary for observational research to adjust for selec- tion effects (Massoglia and Pridemore 2015).\nD. Prospective longitudinal data are a powerful tool in this regard because they allow for the implementa- tion of pretreatment (i.e., incarceration) measures.\nE.

Without proper treatment, ADHD can lead to more behavior problems, poorer social relationships, and lower academic performance (Hinshaw and Scheffler 2014).\nB. However, the effect of an ADHD diagnosis may not be uniformly positive (Owens and Jackson 2017).\nC. Situating ADHD within the broader literature on negative stereotypes surrounding children with disabilities (Pescosolido et al. 2008), diagnosed children may experience negative feelings of being unlike their peers (Hinshaw 2005) and increased scrutiny and lower expectations from teachers (Eisenberg and Schneider 2007).\nD. Rates of childhood ADHD diagnoses are high across social class groups, ranging from 13% among children from families earning below the federal poverty level to 10% of those earning 1 to 3.9 times the poverty level and 9% of those earning at least 4 times the poverty level (Xu et al. 2018).\nE.

Its status as an \u201cinvisible disability\u201d may lead diagnosed children and family members to internalize a sense of culpability for the child's difficulties, which is consistent with experiences of labeling and stigma. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. For children from high-SES backgrounds in particular, parents' ability to activate social capital for school intervention (Lareau 1987) and reflect school values in their home environment (Lareau 2003) combined with fewer other negative exposures may further magnify diagnosed children's sense of being \u201cdisabled\u201d and unable to meet high academic expectations.\nB.

Recent studies that used relatively more sophisticated statistical modeling techniques have provided empirical evidence of the detrimental health impacts of macro levels of income inequality, especially reductions in country-level and U.S. state-level average life expectancy (e.g., Curran and Mahutga 2018; Hill and Jorgenson 2018; Jorgenson et al. 2020). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. A number of studies have also observed inequality to be associated with adult and infant mortality, obesity, HIV infections, mental illness, and homicides (Buot et al. 2014; Daly 2016; Ribeiro et al. 2017; Torre and Myrskyl\u00e4 2014; Wilkinson and Pickett 2010, 2019).\nB. Overall, the majority of these studies suggest that inequality is harmful to human health, well-being, economies, and social cohesion.\nC. Although the demand-side and the supply-side approaches underplay the role of inequality in the drug overdose epidemic, multiple theoretical perspectives that can be applied to drug use help explain why income inequality is related to various population health outcomes (Hill, Jorgenson et al. 2019; Hill and Jorgenson 2018; Jorgenson et al. 2020).\nD. The psychosocial and social capital perspectives take a micro point of view to the inequality health relationship, whereas neomaterialism takes a macro perspective.\nE. The psychosocial perspective suggests that the stress of relative deprivation, from the unequal distribution of income, contributes to low self-esteem, emotional distress, and risky coping behaviors, such as drug use (Wilkinson and Pickett 2010).\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 238}

In the current research, though, we integrate insights from a life course perspective into the study of societal change and social integration. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. We suggest a concept of \u201cintegratory vulnerability,\u201d in which a life course context\u2014and particularly cohort membership and the timing of societal events in the life course\u2014critically differentiates individual vulnerability to disintegratory societal events.\nB. We are guided to the pivotal role of integratory vulnerability by the strong emphasis of research in the life course perspective on the differentiated ramifications of large-scale economic events for individual lives (Elder 1999).\nC. A key paradigmatic principle of a life course perspective is that historical events can affect people differently depending on the timing of these events in the life course (Elder, Johnson, and Crosnoe 2003).\nD. Recent research exemplifies these patterns, demonstrating that the timing of the Great Recession as individuals entered the labor market had subsequent implications for individual earning capabilities (Atherwood and Sparks 2019).\nE.

Women experience a higher incidence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, depression, and disability compared to men (Case and Paxson 2005; Leveille et al. 2000; Nolen-Hoeksema 2001), and rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States have increased over the past several decades (Creanga et al. 2014). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Women also experience more barriers to health care access (Ng et al. 2010; Rustgi, Doty, and Collins 2009), which may exacerbate gender gaps in health.\nB. Women are more likely to be adversely affected by barriers to health care access, in part, because women have greater need for health care services to manage chronic conditions and reproductive care (Case and Paxson 2005; Doyal 2000; Owens 2008).\nC. Unmet health care need is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality for women and higher infant mortality (Atrash et al. 2006; Kent, Patel, and Varela 2012).\nD. Availability of care describes the volume and selection of existing services, including ability to get care when needed, consistency and timeliness of care, and choice of providers (Penchansky and Thomas 1981).\nE. Women are more likely than men to report unmet need for medical care (Long, Stockley, and Shulman 2011) and delays in receiving medical care (Ng et al. 2010).\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 249}
{"query": "You are given the start of a paragraph from a scientific research paper, ending in \"...\". Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    State-level sexism is a robust predictor of women's morbidity and mortality, implicating gender inequities across economic, political, and cultural institutions as pathways leading to poorer health for women. Recent research documents higher mortality rates for women and infants residing in U.S. states with higher levels of economic inequity (Pabayo et al. 2019), and studies using state-level composite scores of economic inequity (e.g., gen- der gaps in wages, employment, and poverty) find higher mortality rates and poorer health for women residing in more inequitable states (Homan 2019; Montez et al. 2016). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Within the political domain, underrepresentation of women in state legislature is associated with higher rates of female and infant mortality (Homan 2017; Kawachi et al. 1999), and the implementation of state policies designed to promote gender equity (e.g., paid family and maternal leave, gun ownership restrictions for domestic violence offenders) predicts better health and lower mortality rates for women (Doran et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2020; Wisdom et al. 2005).\nB. Finally, state-level policies regarding Medicaid eligibility and access to reproductive care have significant implications for the health of women (Hawkins et al. 2020; Johnston et al. 2018; Margerison et al. 2020).\nC. Health care access and quality could underlie the robust associations between state-level sexism and women's health; however, existing literature has not adequately examined the relationship between state- level sexism and health care.\nD. Because the U.S. health care system relies heavily on private, employer-based health insurance, systemic state- level gender gaps in wages and labor force participation may reduce both women's insurance coverage and ability to afford health care.\nE. Indeed, women are more likely to depend on their spouses for health insurance and spend a higher share of their income on health care than men (Patchias and Waxman 2007), supporting the notion that gender inequalities in pay and employment increase barriers to care for women.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 250}

The latter stages of the analysis were restricted to the 21,329 participants who had at least one medical care visit in the past year and had complete data for additional health care access and quality variables. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Supplemental analysis revealed that participants who were excluded from the analysis were more likely to be female, younger (ages 18-34), nonwhite, and unmarried.\nB. We did not use multiple imputation to impute missing data because the source of nearly all missing data was dependent variables, and imputed values for dependent variables are not typically included in regression analy- ses (von Hippel 2007).\nC. Individual-level data came from the December 2014 to January 2019 waves of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Consumer Survey of Health Care Access, a repeat cross-sectional, online survey of adults age 18 and older in the United States.\nD. Surveys were conducted by an external firm that maintains an active panel of potential study participants. Stratified sampling was used to collect data based on age and health insur- ance status, with oversamples of various subpopu- lations of interest (minority, rural, Medicaid recipients, etc.) in particular survey waves.\nE.

Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    As a persistent and ubiquitous global pollutant, Hg deposition of any species and concentration poses potential risks to humans and ecosystems1. Compared with terrestrial environments, coastal environments have many physical, ecological and biogeochemical characteristics that increase the accumulation of Hg and the production, release, bioaccumulation and risk of neurotoxic methylmercury (MMHg, the methylated form of Hg). ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Therefore, Hg stored in coastal ecosystems poses more serious risks to human health and ecosystem safety\nB. However, the sample size, spatial distribution and ecosystem type of coastal sediments in existing studies are extremely limited.\nC. More critically, no attempt has been made to estimate the Hg stock in global coastal sediments, which is one of the fundamental constraints on determining Hg risks in global coastal ecosystems.\nD. The term 'Blue C' entered the lexicon in 2009 and refers to organic C (OC) that is captured and stored by vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs, including seagrass meadows, tidal marshes and mangrove forests).\nE. Recently, tidal mudflats have also entered the Blue C discourse.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 252}
{"query": "You are given the start of a paragraph from a scientific research paper, ending in \"...\". Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    In this Brief Communication, we carry out a targeted survey along Chinese coastlines to document the relationship between coastal habitat types and sediment Hg and OC contents. We find that the sediment of VCEs not only is OC-rich, but also is a Hg-rich system, and that there is a strong and positive correlation between OC contents and Hg concentrations in coastal sediments. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Notably, the Hg/OC ratio reported here (3.95 \u03bcg g-1) is ~2.5 times that of permafrost soils (1.6 \u03bcg g-1), indicating that coastal sediment is a more favourable environment for storing Hg under the same OC sequestration potential as permafrost soils.\nB. The Hg release from anthropogenic activities around coastal regions could additionally increase the Hg/soil OC ratio of coastal sediments.\nC. We combine the linear correlation between OC and Hg in all coastal sediments (N = 819) generated from our regional observational data and the Blue C stock in the top metre of sediment in different Blue C ecosystems compiled by others to roughly estimate the Hg stock in global Blue C ecosystems.\nD. We find that over 95% of the Hg stock in global Blue C ecosystems is stored in VCEs.\nE. Recently, tidal mudflats have also entered the Blue C discourse.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 253}
{"query": "You are given the start of a paragraph from a scientific research paper, ending in \"...\". Choose the most coherent continuation from the options below.\n\n    Query:\n    Our study reveals that extremely limited extents of VCEs (~0.2% of the ocean surface) and their substantial stock and burial flux of Hg highlight the disproportionate importance of the VCEs to global Hg storage and cycling. Blue Hg stock is therefore an important, dynamic, reactive but overlooked Hg pool in the global Hg cycle and health risk. ...\n\n    Options:\n    A. Blue C ecosystems can provide a range of ecosystem services such as protecting biodiversity and fisheries and increasing water quality.\nB. However, the co-accumulation and contrary ecological effects of OC and Hg in coastal ecosystems indicate that expanding Blue C ecosystems are very likely to add to the Blue Hg stock, consequently resulting in an increase of Hg risk in global coastal seas.\nC. Delay and failure to implement the Blue C strategies may well accelerate the impending climate catastrophe and other coastal and ecological disasters, inevitably resulting in substantial economic, ecological and human losses.\nD. We refer to increased Blue Hg stocks and the risk caused by expanding Blue C ecosystems to mitigate climate change and achieve co-benefits as the 'Blue Hg dilemma'.\nE. The close interactions between C and Hg in coastal ecosystems point to the importance of a holistic understanding of the benefits, risks and trade-offs of Blue C sequestration strategies.\n\nAnswer with the letter (A-E) corresponding to the best continuation. **Strictly follow this format\u2014do not include any explanations or additional text.**", "answer": "A", "id": 254}
