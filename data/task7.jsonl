Using data from the United States natality files, we estimate associations between state laws granting undocumented immigrants access to driver's licenses and perinatal outcomes among 4,047,067 singleton births to Mexican and Central American immigrant birthing people (2008-2021). Fitting multivariable log binomial and linear models, we find that the implementation of a license law is associated with improvements in low birthweight and mean birthweight. Replicating these analyses among U.S.-born non-Hispanic White birthing people, we find no association between the implementation of a license law and birthweight. These findings support the hypothesis that states' extension of legal rights to immigrants improves the health of the next generation.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 0}

Using data from the 2008-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), this study provides a partial explanation for the paradox rooted in a very different disparity. Evidence from MEPS indicates that non-Hispanic whites consume more pharmaceuticals than racial-ethnic minorities for a wide variety of medical conditions. Moreover, non-Hispanic whites consume more pharmaceuticals that although effective in treating their focal indication, include depression or suicide as a side effect. In models that adjust for the use of such medications, the minority advantage in significant distress is reduced, in some instances to statistical nonsignificance. Although a significant black and Hispanic advantage in a continuous measure of distress remains, the magnitude of the difference is reduced considerably. The relationship between the use of medications with suicide as a side effect and significant distress is especially large, exceeding, for instance, the relationship between poverty and significant distress. For some minority groups, the less frequent use of such medications is driven by better health (as in the case of Asians), whereas for others, it reflects a treatment disparity (as in the case of blacks), although the consequences for the mental health paradox are the same. The implications of the results are discussed, especially with respect to the neglect of psychological side effects in the treatment of physical disease as well as the problem of multiple morbidities.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 2}

We use the climate change disclosures of 115 companies, which represents the subset of companies with SBTs that have also disclosed data which can be used to assess the contribution of RECs to their reported (2015-2019) and potential future emission reductions. Importantly, it was necessary that all companies in our sample reported their past emissions using both market- and location-based emission accounting methods (Box 1). We also distinguish here between RECs and power purchase agreements (PPAs), which represent a long-term commitment by a company to purchase power from a particular renewable energy project. Although empirical evidence is still needed, we have adopted here the common assumption that PPAs do lead to additional renewable energy production and real emission reductions, as the long-term power price de-risks new projects and allows access to project finance14,15,17,18 (Box 1). By contrast, we assume that RECs and similar market-based instruments are non-additional, that is, not leading to additional renewable generation capacity or real emissions reductions, and we use the term RECs to refer to all non-PPA instruments for that reason (see Methods for details on these market-based instruments and terminology). Although existing literature suggest that RECs are non-additional due to their low and uncertain prices11-18, some claim that RECs may still contribute to the generation of more renewable energy in the longer term by, in aggregation, signaling to the market that there is a demand for renewable energy9,23.

To assess the effects of policy, we utilize spending effort as an operational indicator of policy differences, recognizing that policies may exist with varying levels of funding and that the hypothetical presence of a policy without supportive spending is likely to have little to no effect (Castles 2008). Recent reviews demonstrate that the spending effort in general areas of social policy is associated with SES differences in mental health, where increases in spending generally reduce SES differences both between (McAllister et al. 2018) and within countries (Simpson et al. 2021). Between-country differences highlight the importance of contextual differences in policy environments for SES inequalities in mental health, averaged over time, whereas within-country analysis demonstrate changes in either the direction or magnitude of specific policy effects over a given period. Between-country studies find greater levels of active labor market (Niedzwiedz et al. 2016) and sickness benefit spending (van der Wel et al. 2015) reduce educational differences in mental health. Within-country analyses demonstrate that SES inequalities are impacted by the direction of spending effort so that increases reduce and reductions increase inequalities across family policies (Lebihan and Mao Takongmo 2018; Milligan and Stabile 2011), social assistance (Herbst 2013), and old age security (Carrino, Glaser, and Avendano 2020).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 5}

Education has been associated with assorted morbidities, mortality risk, disability, general health, mental health, and an array of health-related behaviors linked to various health outcomes (Adams 2002; Arendt 2005; Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010; Lleras-Muney 2005; Turner and Lloyd 1999). One important question about the links between education and health that remains unanswered, however, is whether these links are robust for individuals who pursued schooling at a stage of the life course when education has normatively been completed (as reflected in formal definitions of nontraditional students, as well as institutional expectations and structures): prior to having children (Macmillan 2005; Marini1984). This question of whether \u201cout-of-sequence\u201d education can promote greater health is particularly salient for women with children, who (based on estimates from 2015 to 2016), represent over 15% of all students enrolled in college and 70% of all student parents (Cruse et al. 2019).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 9}

To achieve such targets, residual emissions, such as methane emissions in agriculture, need to be offset by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere, where BECCS and DACCS emerge as key options for technical CDR23-25.Biomass is a limited resource and its use for energy can be associated with a range of positive and negative environmental, social and economic effects that are context specific and depend on land type and climatic region, prior land use and how bioenergy feedstock and management regimes are shaped26-33. Due to concerns about possible environmental impacts, insufficient emissions reductions and competition with the food sector, EU policy has capped biofuels from food and feed crops and increasingly emphasizes lignocellulosic biomass, especially residues and waste34,35, and prioritizes the biomass usage to  energy applications where other alternatives are currently difficult to find or considered to be too costly. All of the possible biomass usage options face competition from electricity-derived energy carriers and fossil fuels (Extended Data Fig. 1). A full systems analysis of biomass allocation to different energy uses therefore requires broad coverage of options and sectors. Such analyses have been carried out with global integrated assessment models (IAMs), with a large variety in results, but with biomass in the longer term generally ending up being used for electricity and/or liquid fuels production36, coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS)37,38. The potential value of negative emissions from BECCS has been found to be very high, enabling the achievement of more ambitious climate targets37,39-41 or delayed phase-out of fossil fuels if temperature overshoot is permitted40,41.

However, simply aggregating the (seemingly ideal) effects of multiple policies does not accurately reflect the actual policy outcome, as the trade-offs and synergies between policies can weaken or strengthen their effects12,13. Combining and sequencing policy implementation can largely impact the efficiency, stringency and externality of mitigation policies14-16.

One of the primary areas of empirical evidence comes from periods of economic turmoil (Cockerham 2017), as increasing rates of foreclosure and unemployment were associated with spikes in suicide rates following the Great Recession (Houle and Light 2014; Phillips and Nugent 2014). Closer to individual outcomes, meso-level changes in foreclosure rates following the recession were also inversely associated with individual mental health (Houle 2014; Settels 2020). An additional line of research linking social change to integration has argued that increases in birth cohort size and births to unwed mothers are causative agents in declining levels of social integration that affect suicide rates (O'Brien and Stockard 2006; Stockard and O'Brien 2002). It is notable, however, that much of this research is conducted purely at a contextual level and does not clearly tie rapid social change to individual experiences of social isolation. The current study therefore builds on this body of evidence to demonstrate whether increases in perceptions of social isolation contributed to a rise in psychological distress following the onset of the pandemic.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 13}

Combined, U.S. obstetric environments likely allow implicit biases and obstetric racism to influence IOL decisions (Davis 2019; Liese et al. 2021; Vedam et al. 2019). More broadly, systemic and cultural racism shape social conditions and practices that generate racial inequities in health care access and heath policies (Cogburn 2019). These racialized processes likely shape obstetric practices in the United States. As a result, it is possible that rising IOL rates among pregnancies to White women are partly responding to changes in the health and risk factors of this childbearing population. By contrast, rising IOL rates among U.S. Black and Latina women may not have occurred because of the changes or needs in these childbearing populations but, rather, because of the standardization of U.S. obstetric care practices based on the changes and  needs among White women. In short, obstetric racism and the failure to center U.S. obstetric care at the margins likely has produced more \u201cinterventions without explanation\u201d among Black and Latina women than among White women (Davis 2019:569).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 14}

A 1 \u00b5g m-3 increase in wildfire-specific PM2.5was associated with increased hospitalization risks for all-cause respiratory, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute upper respiratory infection, influenza and pneumonia by 0.36%, 0.48%, 0.38%, 0.42%, 0.79% and 0.36%, respectively.

Whether withdrawing some of these financial incentives would curb development, lower the costs of disasters and help communities prepare for climate change is unclear. Many factors affect development decisions and federal incentives are only some of the factors at play.

This analysis controlled for population, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and energy use per unit of GDP, and encompasses 56 countries over a 10-year period (Supplementary Information 1). Results suggest that corporate tax competition could hinder climate cooperation and present challenges to climate change mitigation efforts2. Corporate tax competition influences the geographical distribution of production and global emissions by influencing foreign investment flows and trade flows, which are the two main channels of international carbon transfer. Intuitively, a corporate tax cut in one country would increase the net profits of firms located in this country and attract more multinational production (MP) activities, which may further stimulate more exports. Meanwhile, changes in corporate tax rates also affect government revenue, which in turn can have an impact on a country's consumption patterns and overall output. The production allocation would further change global and regional CO2 emissions. To comprehensively quantify the emission effect of the global corporate tax changes, we build a multi-country multi-industry general equilibrium model by incorporating MNEs, international trade flows and corporate tax. We calibrate the model and quantify the economic and emission impacts of two global corporate tax shocks: the global corporate tax competition and the global minimum tax policy approved by OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries in 2021.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 18}

That is, it is the outcome of using models that rely on the historical relationship between a firm's financial performance and past risk as a predictor of future risk. As discussed in the literature and by policymakers, such models are useful but may not be well suited to capturing uncertain macro-economic outcomes when there are structural breaks or non-marginal changes in the system, such as the clean energy transition. In these risk-based models, the creditworthiness of firms is often  estimated through financial ratios measuring profitability (for example, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes (EBIT)/Revenue), solvency (for example, Debt/Asset, Interest/EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciations and Amortizations)) and liquidity (for example, short-term debt/ working capital). If these ratios have been historically favourable for high-carbon firms, as previous research has highlighted37, risk models will probably produce favourable outcomes for this type of investment.

The plans for future LULUCF vary in their concreteness and detail; some include several scenarios specifying amounts of future LULUCF while others offer only vague ideas about future mitigation through LULUCF. Most countries expect to enhance or maintain the removal capacity  of the LULUCF sector (Table 3). For many of the countries that plan for enhanced removals from the LULUCF sector, these removals will equal or surpass their expected residual emissions by the point of net zero. This is the case for, among others, Finland, Iceland, Hungary,  Latvia, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. However, for the biggest emitters in the sample, expected LULUCF removals fall far short of residuals. This is the case for Australia, Canada, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Taken together, these six countries comprise 96% of the total residuals of the sample. As these countries comprise the majority of residuals, their plans will be decisive for the overall amount of residuals that will have to be removed through means other than the LULUCF sector.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 20}

Some renewables, such as solar, are variable and cannot be generated according to market needs, which creates challenges in matching supply with demand. Demand-side response (DSR) measures are gaining prominence as a way to align demand with non-dispatchable supply. The residential sector accounts for 30-40% of electricity consumption across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, which makes it a prime target for DSR1. Decision makers, such as the California Public Utilities Commission, are enacting policies that require default enrolment in DSR programmes2, which can yield participation rates that exceed 80% (ref. 3); other entities may follow4.

Specifically, the development of solar leasing models with minimal up-front costs has driven a more equitable expansion of rooftop solar12,13 and the recent emergence of solar loans may similarly address up-front cost barriers. However, rooftop solar remains largely inaccessible to renters and families living in multifamily housing14,15. Another alternative class of solar products in the United States is community solar, wherein multiple customers buy output from a single solar system16. As with leasing, community solar typically entails no or minimal up-front costs. Unlike rooftop solar, community solar poses no specific barriers to adoption for renters or multifamily building occupants. As a result, community solar is often theorized to promote more equitable solar access15,17-22 and is increasingly integrated into US solar adoption equity policies11.

However, the role of existing financial regulations in influencing investment decisions is understudied. Here we analyse data from the European Banking Authority to show that existing financial accounting frameworks might inadvertently be creating disincentives for investments in low-carbon assets. We find that differences in the provision coverage ratio indicate that banks must account for nearly double the loan loss provisions for lending to low-carbon sectors as compared with high-carbon sectors. This bias is probably the result of basing risk estimates on historical data. We show that the average historical financial risk of the oil and gas sector has been consistently estimated to be lower than that of renewable energy. These results indicate that this bias could be present in other model-based regulations, such as capital requirements, and possibly impact the ability of banks to fund green investments.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 23}

The attack has also led to a negative supply shock of oil, partly because Russia's ability to export has been hampered by the lack of will to insure Russian ships3, but also due to industry preparation for the upcoming EU oil import ban4. Together with surging post-pandemic demand, this has led to very high prices of transport fuels5,6. In response, a large number of European countries are either discussing or have already implemented a reduction in fuel taxes to help consumers cope with high prices. These include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and Sweden (see the Methods section 'Fuel price and taxes' and, for example, refs. 7-9 for details). Such tax reductions have problematic consequences since they increase demand, thus making current supply even more scarce. Some of the tax reduction will be attenuated by an increase in the underlying oil price, leading to increased profits for oil producers. Here, we assess the magnitude of this effect using basic theory and empirical estimates from the oil sector. We ask: 'How much does the oil income in Russia increase following fuel-tax reductions in the EU?' Knowing the answer to this question is highly relevant to policy as Russia's oil profits may undermine the geopolitical interests of the EU, reduce the effectiveness of the EU's sanctions and ultimately improve the ability of Russia to wage war.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 24}

We define peer referral narrowly to mean when existing programme participants provide names to the programme provider of others who might enrol; we exclude informal word-of-mouth. Compared with other outreach strategies, peer referral can more efficiently find programme participants20,21: referrers know eligibility requirements and can more readily identify qualified peers. Peer referral also leverages social influence, a widely recognized driver of energy technology adoption22,23 that may be especially influential among low-to-moderate income (LMI) households16,24. Since individuals often know who referred them, a peer's nomination may signal endorsement for the programme, reduce distrust of the provider and ultimately increase participation. And in contrast to other peer-based strategies (for example, ambassador programmes25), peer referral programmes may be easier to scale: there is no need to identify and train individuals willing to become ongoing  programme advocates. Asking existing clients for nominations instead of word-of-mouth referrals also removes the onus of convincing peers to contact the programme provider.Despite its potential benefits, methods to increase peer referral for social benefit programmes have received little attention. The few studies so far test the efficacy of referral incentives for subsidized health programmes, with mixed results and sometimes limited sample sizes19,26. Most studies aimed at improving programme uptake instead focus on directly recruiting new participants\u2014overlooking the potential benefits of tapping existing programme beneficiaries to reach their peers.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 26}

Despite a growing consensus that lifestyles likely extend beyond behaviors, extant (mostly quantitative) research has measured only health behaviors. Furthermore, although it has long been understood that health lifestyles are collective (Cockerham, R\u00fctten, and Abel 1997; Frohlich and Potvin 1999), empirical research has examined them in individuals. Importantly, health lifestyles are theorized to be contextually specific (Cockerham et al. 2004), but almost all research has used national or geographically dispersed samples. Finally, Cockerham (2005:61) theorized, but empirical work has not yet shown, that people \u201calign their goals, needs, and desires with their probabilities for realizing them and choose a lifestyle according to their assessments of the reality of their resources and class circumstances.\u201d This \u201cinterplay between life choices and life chances\u201d (Cockerham 2005:60), in which people choose lifestyles from among available options, is fundamental to health lifestyles theory but has not been empirically documented.

This policy mitigates carbon emissions from the LU sector, including those caused by bioenergy production. Under such a highly idealized policy framework, bioenergy can be treated as carbon neutral in the energy sector, since the associated emissions are regulated in the LU sector. However, in the current real-world situation, energy and LU policies are regionally and sectorally fragmented. While many countries have already started to implement GHG emission pricing in the energy sector, institutional capacity building is much less developed in the agricultural and forestry sectors26, leaving a regulatory gap of emissions in the LU sector27. The implicit assumption in IAMs of institutional feasibility of LU mitigation has been criticized28, because the regulatory gap can lead to substantial emission leakage from regulated to unregulated regions29,30 or sectors18,31,32 involving excess bioenergy production.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 31}

We find that a slow recovery from the pandemic and fuel price changes because of ambitious climate mitigation policy could substantially retard progress in achieving universal clean cooking access if additional policies related to energy access and poverty alleviation are not simultaneously pursued. Those most at risk of not being able to afford to transition to clean cooking are low-income households in sub-Saharan Africa (AFR), developing Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAM).

This builds on the well-established concepts of emissions gaps21 and recent extensions towards a carbon dioxide removal gap22. Looking back, we define the past implementation gap as the difference between announced and eventually realized capacity in 2022 and 2023 (Fig. 1a). Looking ahead to 2030, we define the ambition gap as the difference  between 1.5 \u00b0C scenario requirements and announced projects and find that it has been gradually closing in the past 3 years for most scenarios (Fig. 1b). However, this has been accompanied by a widening future implementation gap, which we define as the difference between announced projects and projects that are backed by policies in 2030 (Fig. 1b). Analysing the competition between green hydrogen (and hydrogen-based electrofuels) and incumbent fossil competitors across 14 end-use sectors, we estimate that realizing all green hydrogen projects would require subsidies, or alternative policies such as end-use quotas, for at least another decade, even with ambitious carbon pricing and potentially indefinitely without.

The NFIP provides almost 5 million policies to homeowners and businesses in the USA, covering US$1.2 trillion in assets and making it the largest flood insurance market worldwide6. The program requires households in a participating community with a bank-backed mortgage living within a 100-year flood zone to purchase mandatory flood insurance coverage. It also requires that new developments in these zones meet certain building codes. These low-lying flood zones are mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, the program has a US$20.5 billion debt due to, amongst other things, the setting of premiums on the basis of national averages that do not reflect local risk, new development in flood-impacted areas, and the lack of incentives for homeowners to implement flood adaptation measures other than building elevation7.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 42}

For example, New York City's (NYC's) most recent carbon inventory estimates that building energy use is responsible for approximately 67% of citywide emissions2. Given the substantial contribution of the built environment to global GHG emissions, city policymakers have made increasing building energy efficiency a central component of long-term sustainability goals. As new construction represents a small fraction of the building stock of a given city in any year, city energy policies are increasingly focused on ways to improve the efficiency of existing buildings3. Informational energy regulations, which are premised on the idea that an absence of data and transparency causes suboptimal investment in energy efficiency4, have become popular policy instruments to encourage market-based interventions for energy use reductions. More than 20 cities in the United States, including Austin, Chicago and San Francisco, have adopted energy informational policies in recent years, and the pace of adoption continues to increase5.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 45}

The vast majority of feedback programmes on energy consumption use opt-in recruitment strategies, where participants actively register to take part in those programmes7,9. There is increasing evidence that individuals who sign up for energy efficiency studies or demand-side management programmes are indeed different from the general population: participation rates are higher among households with high levels of education and income18,19, among more altruistic and environmentally concerned individuals18 and among those with a higher interest and expertise in energy topics than the general population9,20. Most behavioural programmes do not even provide information about the number of households initially contacted, and those that do, report participation rates in the range of 4-8%6,20-23. These numbers have raised concerns that the results of opt-in studies may be largely biased by an already-motivated subgroup of the general population ('energy enthusiasts' or 'positive greens'), who represent only a small fraction of the population9,24. The response of these volunteers to the treatments may not be very indicative for the response of the  general population (volunteer selection bias). On the one hand, it is conceivable that those individuals are already more aware of effective energy conservation measures and have already taken action before the intervention, making it more difficult for them to realize additional savings in those studies25. On the other hand, it is likely that they are particularly open and receptive to these interventions, thus inflating estimates of intervention effectiveness26.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 47}

Eight days later, a second vaccine, Moderna, was approved for use in individuals ages 18 and older. However, distribution of the vaccine has been a logistical hurdle necessitating extremely low temperature cold storage and personnel needs, all while having to maintain COVID-19  safety protocols. For example, unpunctured vials of the vaccines must be kept between -90\u00b0C and -60\u00b0C for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and between -50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C for the Moderna vaccine, well below the temperature of a standard freezer. An obvious question that has emerged is how to do this equitably, especially when vaccine supply is low. Roughly following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2020a), in the case of Texas, which is focus of this analysis, Phase 1A of the rollout was reserved for frontline health care workers, residents of long-term nursing facilities for the elderly, and workers in those same facilities. Phase 1B included people ages 65 and above and people ages 16 and above with at least one comorbidity defined by the state as being particularly vulnerable for the disease, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, chronic heart disease, and so on.

Drawing on the neo-materialist perspective, we examine whether the longitudinal association between income inequality and life expectancy is mediated and moderated by policy liberalism in U.S. states (2000-2014). More liberal policy contexts are characterized by greater efforts to regulate the economy, redistribute income, and protect vulnerable groups and lesser efforts to penalize deviant social behavior. We find that state-level income inequality is inversely associated with policy liberalism and life expectancy. The association between income inequality and life expectancy was not mediated by policy liberalism but was moderated by it. The association is attenuated in states with more liberal policy contexts, supporting the neo-materialist perspective. This finding illustrates how states like New York and California (with liberal policy contexts) can exhibit high income inequality and high life expectancy.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 66}

To address this need, we explore a suite of high ambition emissions pathways\u2014developed using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM; Methods)14\u2014in which countries are assumed to use various combinations of three strategies to ratchet ambition: (1) increasing near-term actions through 2030, (2) accelerating post-2030 emissions reductions and (3) moving forward the timing of dates that countries pledge to hit net-zero emissions. We then use a reduced-form climate model (Hector)15 to compute the end-of-century and peak temperature change implications of the emissions pathways. Our study builds off and extends previous modelling studies that have explored high ambition emissions pathways6,8,16-20.

This paper addresses this gap, by analysing the German solar PV and onshore wind power financing market, which has a particularly long investment history23. We exploit the fact that utility-scale renewable energy investments in Germany are almost exclusively realized in project finance structures24 (see Supplementary Note 1 for a description), in which the costs of capital reveal unbiased information about the underlying investment projects and technologies25. We proceed in four steps. First, using newly compiled project data, we depict the CoC and its components and analyse the changes over 18 years. Second, we use qualitative insights from in-depth interviews with 41 investment professionals to identify the drivers of the observed changes in financing conditions. Third, we quantify an experience effect within the renewable energy finance industry, leading to lower costs of capital. Fourth, we quantify the effect of the observed changes in costs of capital on LCOEs. The methods are structured along the same four steps. We find that the CoC declined by 69% for solar PV and by 58% for wind onshore projects between the early period of the RET finance industry (2000-2005) and 2017. For both technologies, the cost of debt decreased more than the cost of equity. Focusing on the cost of debt, we identify and estimate a financing experience curve. For each doubling of cumulative investment, the debt margins (see Supplementary Table 1 for definitions of financial terms) decreased by 11% for both technologies. During the same time, we observe a decline in the general interest rate resulting in lower costs of capital that had a substantial effect on the economic attractiveness of RETs. Finally, we estimate that 41% of total solar PV LCOE reductions and 40% of wind onshore LCOE reductions between 2000-2005 and 2017 were due to lower financing costs. These result from three effects: lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) to be financed (strongest effect for solar PV), lower general interest rate (strongest effect for wind onshore), and financing experience. We conclude with implications for researchers and policymakers.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 77}

Despite the substantial burden of wildfire-related health impacts on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)10, research investigating the health consequences of wildfire-specific PM2.5in these regions remains surprisingly limited. Previous investigations have largely been conducted in high-income countries, such as the United States and Canada, focusing on a specific local area or fire event9,11-17. This focus potentially hinders the generalizability of findings to other countries disproportionately burdened by wildfires, such as Chile and Brazil. Furthermore, studies in LMICs are imperative to inform targeted intervention and resource allocation directed towards areas with the greatest need, ultimately contributing to global health equity. To date, only two multicountry studies have investigated the impacts of wildfire-specific PM2.5on respiratory health.

The SES-mental health association is also one of the most consistent in social science (Thoits 2010), spanning over a century of research (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend 1969; Faris and Dunham 1939; Hollingshead and Redlich 1958; Jarvis 1855; Srole et al. 1962) and continuing to the present day (Miech and Shanahan 2000; Warren 2009). This consistency within countries, predominantly estimated in the North American context, supports a social causation interpretation, net of social selection (Warren 2009; Wheaton 1978), indicating SES as a primary social determinant of mental health. However, cross-national comparisons across countries demonstrate that the strength of the association between SES indicators, such as education, occupation, and income, and mental health outcomes differs (Rai et al. 2013), implying contextual social determinants may be driving differences in the effect of SES between countries while also demonstrating the generality of the existence of this association across very different national contexts (Pr\u00e4g, Mills, and Wittek 2016).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 79}

However, analyses on climate-tech startups tend to focus on public agencies10,11 or financially motivated venture capital (VC)2,5 in isolation, without considering the combined effects of different investors. For example, public funding agencies can de-risk technologies when securing traditional investment is difficult12 or support technologies relevant for strategic national goals13. Traditional VC investors aim for high financial returns from startups exiting through an initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition. Climate-impact investors have emerged as a subset of profit-focused investors, with a focus on supporting climate tech while still pursuing financial returns. Corporations, in contrast, are strategic investors that may seek to increase profits but also to achieve goals related to long-term business plans and competitive standing9,14-19. They can help startups build commercial capacity and credibility20, increase innovation output21 and provide learning benefits22, but they can also leave startups at risk for predatory acquisitions that undercut competition and misappropriate intellectual property19,22. The motivations of these different investors collectively determine how investments flow to technology areas and risk levels12. These investments, in turn, can have distinct effects on startup outcomes. However, policymakers currently have limited empirical evidence on how different investors shape startup outcomes, which could enable more effective strategies to address the threat of climate change.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 83}

These efforts, however, have not been entirely successful. Research has uncovered some important protective factors, to be sure, but these factors are not always relevant or suitable to explaining the minority paradox. They either apply only to coping with certain forms of stress, have highly complex and contingent associations with mental health, or are not uniformly more common among racial-ethnic minorities (Ellison, Musick, and Henderson 2008; Jackson, Knight, and Rafferty 2010; Odom, Garrett-Peters, and Vernon-Feagans 2014; Phinney and Haas 2003). As an alternative explanation for the paradox, some scholars have turned to measurement biases in common measures of mental health (Sue et al. 2012). Yet here, too, such explanations are limited, at least for purposes of explaining the paradox. Measurement differences between groups are generally not large or consistent enough to explain the paradox altogether (Alegr\u00eda and McGuire 2003).

Indeed, medical providers demonstrate bias on par with the general population, even among those who self-identify as holding nondiscriminatory beliefs (Burgess et al. 2007; van Ryn and Fu 2003; Zestcott, Blair, and Stone 2016). Understanding such bias is important because it contributes to the profound health disparities seen in the United States. For instance, providers counsel and treat patients differently depending on patient characteristics, which often disproportionately affects marginalized populations, who consistently experience worse health outcomes (see Bao, Fox, and Escarce 2007; Schulman et al. 1999; van Ryn et al. 2006). Yet beyond recognizing the presence of bias in providers' patient counseling and decision-making, minimal research has explored how providers then navigate bias in their care to minimize its effects. By exploring this process, we demonstrate the ways that various provider approaches to reduce bias reflect and reproduce this inequality in care. Elucidating these coping strategies simultaneously reveals not only providers' individually held biases but also the social forces that engender such discrimination and disparities within their clinical encounters.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 93}

For a wide array of national decarbonization targets, we find that the nationwide cost from heterogeneous subnational policies is only one-tenth higher than nationally uniform policies.

Some countries have even implemented a zero tax rate to attract international capital inflows. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) may take advantage of differing tax regimes between jurisdictions and effectively avoid paying taxes. To prevent this, a global minimum tax, the second pillar of the overall global tax reform agreement, was approved by over 130 countries and jurisdictions in October 2021. The reform is designed to ensure that MNEs are subject to a minimum tax rate of 15% in every country of operation starting in 2023. As MNEs play a central role in shaping countries' production patterns, the global race to the bottom in corporate tax and the global minimum tax reform may reshape the global production network, adversely impacting economic and environmental development. Corporate tax-cutting may even offset the burden of climate regulations and challenge CO2 mitigation. For instance, developing countries,  which usually have greater carbon intensity and lower corporate  tax rates, tend to be tax havens1. Consequently, the global tax race has led to more production moving to developing countries and reshaping the global production network, which could increase global carbon emissions.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 105}

These would increase the price on fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, end-use electricity and petroleum) to decrease fossil fuel consumption (for example, Coalition of Finance Ministers). However, and repeatedly recognized during both the 26th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP26) meeting in Glasgow and the recently finalized COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, many countries currently have policies that keep end-user prices artificially low through subsidies. This encourages increases in both production and consumption of fossil fuels and thus effectively counteracts the intended objective of carbon pricing. In addition, subsidies represent a burden on the governments' fiscal budgets through deficits and revenue losses. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that tax breaks and spending programmes (fossil fuel support) in the G20 countries, linked to both the production and use of coal, oil, gas and other petroleum products, had risen to US$190 billion in 2021, a level that is higher than in previous years (30% higher than in 2020)1. The OECD and International Energy Agency (IEA) have also estimated that governments in 51 countries provided US$697.2 billion in fossil fuel subsidies in 2021, doubling the amount from 20202, an amount that is three times the annual amount needed to eradicate global extreme poverty3.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 107}

This is equivalent to \u20ac3,100 million per year, 0.2% of Russia's gross domestic product or 5% of its military spending. We show that a cash transfer to EU citizens\u2014with a fiscal burden equivalent to the tax cut\u2014reduces these side effects to a fraction.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 109}

To this end, science-based targets (SBTs) intend to align voluntary company-level emission reduction targets with the global temperature goal of the Paris Agreement4-6. So far SBTs have been set by more than 1,000 companies, including many multinationals7,8. When reporting scope 2 emissions, that is, emissions associated with the generation of purchased energy (primarily electricity, but also including steam, heat and cooling), the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) allows companies to use renewable energy certificates (RECs) to claim the use of renewably generated electricity. Companies can then report zero emissions for each unit of electricity consumption covered by purchased RECs9, regardless of the actual emissions produced by the electricity grid at their location; however, RECs do not reflect the physical electricity flow supplied to the companies purchasing them10, and there is evidence that RECs are unlikely to lead to additional renewable energy generation11-18. Consequently, company-level emission reductions reported through RECs are unlikely to reflect real reductions of global emissions, which has the potential to compromise the alignment of SBTs with the Paris temperature goal19,20. In recognition of this issue, several emission accounting standards21,22 restrict or do not endorse the use of RECs, but RECs are nevertheless permitted by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol9 that forms the basis of SBTi's requirements.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 110}

Shortfalls in the announced deployment of electrolysers, the key component for green hydrogen production, are representative of the systemic challenges of scaling up supply, demand and infrastructure at the same time. In 2022, instead of the 2.8 GW electrolysis capacity initially announced, eventually only 0.62 GW was realized on time (Fig. 1a). Similarly, in 2023, of the 7.1 GW initially announced, only an estimated 0.92 GW was realized and operational. In stark contrast to these recent setbacks, announced future growth rates of green hydrogen have increased substantially over the past 3 years, indicating a backlog of projects as well as further increasing ambition (Fig. 1b). This raises questions such as whether recent failure rates and the looming 'valley of death'20 can be overcome to meet updated project announcements, whether the expected role of hydrogen in ambitious climate change mitigation scenarios has changed and what plausible implementation pathways exist given currently announced hydrogen support policies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 111}

Moreover, because little is known about how providers manage this bias within their patient interactions, recommendations for improving these encounters may inevitably fall short. Indeed, the patient-provider relationship is central to the provision of health care. Patients are, overall, more active consumers than in the past, and the provider-patient relationship has become less paternalistic as a result. However, because of how U.S. health care is structured and the rise of disease nationwide, the clinical encounter is pivotal to health outcomes because providers guide downstream access to care (Boyer and Lutfey 2010). As such, the quality of these exchanges must be continuously assessed.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 113}

Therefore, Hg stored in coastal ecosystems poses more serious risks to human health and ecosystem safety10. Field measurements show that OC-rich coastal sediments are generally accompanied by elevated Hg concentrations since sedimentary OC provides a large surface area and strong binding sites for divalent Hg (Hg(II)) (ref. 9). However, the sample size, spatial distribution and ecosystem type of coastal sediments in existing studies are extremely limited9,11-13.

The first wave of investment, known as Cleantech 1.0 (2005-2011; Supplementary Note 1), resulted in many failures that scholars attribute in large part to the poor fit with traditional VC models that expect exits within ten years2,23,24.

However, both sustained use of cleaner fuels16,17 and cessation of solid fuel use are required18 to achieve the stated health outcomes of PMUY. Many households simultaneously use multiple  fuels\u2014termed fuel stacking\u2014rather than moving step-by-step along an energy ladder towards cleaner fuels19. Using panel data collected from the rural areas of six major energy access-deprived states in India in 2014-2015 and 2018, we assess the determinants of upward shifts in LPG use\u2014from use as a minority fuel for cooking only, to the primary fuel and then as the exclusive cooking fuel. By examining dynamic fuel stacking instead of LPG consumption, this study identifies factors that help households to transition away from solid fuel use and towards cleaner fuels. We report a number of important findings. First, PMUY beneficiaries have considerably lower odds of primary and exclusive use of LPG than general customers. Second, the village-level penetration of LPG as a primary fuel and the age of the LPG connection are both positively associated with sustained use. Third, we find that easy access to free-of-cost biomass is a major deterrent to the exclusive use of LPG.

For example, studies emphasizing private passenger car electrification have shown that costs for key components such as batteries are expected to fall substantially and quickly24-26, with increasing evidence that battery-electric vehicles will constitute the primary technology1,27. However, electrifying heavy commercial trucks, such as US Class 7/8 or European N2/N3, still poses a tremendous challenge, particularly due to altered requirements limiting the transferability of passenger car findings. This can be ascribed to inherently versatile operating characteristics from urban delivery to international long haul, distinct utilization schedules, versatile value-adding duties from cargo transport to ancillary power- or energy-intensive services, greater lifetime mileage even beyond 1 million km, high reliability and longevity and an even more pronounced cost sensitivity13,16,18,28. Hence, accurate and comprehensive data on current and projected ZET acquisition costs are essential to assess the future roles of these technologies. However, data are scarce and heterogeneous, whereas a holistic overview assessing multiple components for heavy ZETs within a consistent scope and comparative method is missing. Thus, we address the following research question: what are the most likely future cost developments of central ZET components until 2050?\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 131}

Although globally it accounts for approximately 10% of electricity production capacity, it now has a leading market share in some pioneering countries1,2. As technology rapidly improves and operating facilities increase in age, the modernization of wind facilities becomes increasingly relevant. Repowering, that is, the combined activity of dismantling or refurbishing and commissioning of wind turbines, has been an active segment of the industry since the 1990s, when the first commercial wind farms (commissioned in the late 1970s and early 1980s) began to require substantial reinvestments and modernization, but the scale and impact of repowering on the global wind industry is expected to grow substantially in the next decade. Moreover, although repowering activity to date has been concentrated in a few markets and driven by relatively unique policy incentives, by the late 2020s repowering could become a primary source of business activity for the wind industry across Europe, North America and China, and a key to optimizing wind energy utilization in the context of energy transition. Today, only a few countries have wind energy fleets that support substantial repowering activity2. In this context, empirically derived insights from repowering activities are increasingly informative. Denmark is a prime case for analysis: wind energy has emerged as the primary electricity production technology, having reached a 47% market share in 20193, and it features the oldest wind turbine fleet in the world1,4 (Table 1). Further factors that contribute to a robust repowering market in Denmark are the size of the country, with its consequent space limitations, and its continued desire to expand wind energy production5.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 132}

In Western countries, these policies often take the form of subsidies for home retrofits2-6, heating-system and efficiency upgrades3,4,7,8, and solar panels3,7,9\u2014with some policies, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, covering 100% of costs for households below certain income thresholds. However, even when goods and services are 'free', attracting qualified households can be difficult. Studies show that low-income individuals often fail to take advantage of the social benefits programmes for which they qualify10, including cash11 and food assistance programmes12, and subsidized healthcare13,14. Indeed, research on low-income energy programmes finds that participation rates can be quite low1,15, owing to non-economic barriers such as lack of information, high transaction costs1,15, the need for home repair, and distrust of programme providers1,16,17. Eligible households may also question the need for unfamiliar technologies (for example, heat pumps) when their homes already provide the same services (that is, heat)18. Further complicating matters, administrators of social benefits programmes often have incomplete information about which individuals qualify for services10,19, leading budgets to be spent inefficiently on outreach.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 133}

However, previous analyses suggest that corporate REC purchases are unlikely to lead to additional renewable energy production. Here we show that the widespread use of RECs by companies with science-based targets has led to an inflated estimate of the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. When removing the emission reductions claimed through RECs, companies' combined 2015-2019 scope 2 emission trajectories are no longer aligned with the 1.5 \u00b0C goal, and only barely with the well below 2 \u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. If this trend continues, 42% of committed scope 2 emission reductions will not result in real-world mitigation. Our findings suggest a need to revise accounting guidelines to require companies to report only real emission reductions as progress towards meeting their science-based targets.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 134}

In a world of insufficient climate mitigation efforts, these technologies can help the decline of CO2 emissions, offset hard-to-abate emissions and aid recovery from temperature overshoot2. Although they are criticized for being currently immature or speculative3,4, as well as for the possibility of crowding out emission reductions5-7, there is consensus that NETs will be needed at scale to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. Therefore, research and development on these technologies is necessary to reduce the uncertainty about their cost, potential and scalability, and to build an effective and efficient portfolio of options to reach net-zero or net-negative emissions.

Few countries provide an explicit definition or elaborate how residual emissions amounts are arrived at, explain what criteria were used to determine them or specify what greenhouse gases make up the residual emissions.

By contrast, France and Nepal exemplify a more fluid understanding, where the need for residual emissions owes to 'the current state of knowledge' and with the expectation that technological advancement might change this.

However, the environmental consequences of these policies remain ambiguous. Here we compile environmentally extended multiregional input-output tables to estimate household carbon footprints for different population age groups in China. Subsequently, we estimate the age-sex-specific population under different fertility policies up to 2060 and assess the impacts of fertility and retirement policies on household carbon footprints. We find that Chinese young people have relatively higher household carbon footprints than their older counterparts due to differences in income by age group. Relaxing fertility policies and delaying retirement age are associated with an increase in population (and labour supply) and thus increases in household carbon footprints, with the majority of these increases from the fertility side.

We demonstrate the utility of the framework by designing a cooperative adaptive management policy for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that balances the transboundary economic and biophysical interests of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.

However, the effect of different land-use and energy sector policies on specific bioenergy emissions has not been studied so far. Using the global integrated assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE, we derive a biofuel emission factor (EF) for different policy frameworks. We find that a uniform price on emissions from both sectors keeps biofuel emissions at 12 kg CO2 GJ-1. However, without land-use regulation, the EF increases substantially (64 kg CO2 GJ-1 over 80 years, 92 kg CO2 GJ-1 over 30 years). We also find that comprehensive coverage (>90%) of carbon-rich land areas worldwide is key to containing land-use emissions. Pricing emissions indirectly on the level of bioenergy consumption reduces total emissions by cutting bioenergy demand but fails to reduce the average EF. In the absence of comprehensive and timely land-use regulation, bioenergy thus may contribute less to climate change mitigation than assumed previously.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 141}

Through what Foucault (1991) termed governmentality, policies may induce institutions to foster individual-level behavioral choices that cohere with the aims of the government. Throughout the twentieth century, governmental policy regarding drug supply increasingly focused on the criminal justice system (MacCoun and Reuter 2001). By relying on policies that define certain drugs as illicit, there is a natural reliance by the state on the criminal justice system to curb supply. According to Foucault (1982), however, use of policing to influence individual-level behavior is inefficient and often counterproductive. Surveillance systems that induce self-governing behavior rather than direct coercion are more efficient because they reduce the resources required to align behavior with governmental aims (Foucault 1995). Policies may employ influence on behavior across a continuum from the tacit forms of behavioral persuasion akin to Foucault's panopticon through direct mandates for action. In this regard, coercion may occur not only through explicit mandates but also in implicit forms that give the appearance of choice as well. Surveillance systems within the scope of the health care system may appear, at face value, to be less coercive.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 142}

U.S. life expectancy stagnated for five years (2010 to 2014) and subsequently declined for another three (2015 to 2017)\u2014an unheralded decline among high-income nations (Crimmins and Zhang 2019; Woolf and Schoomaker 2019). Underneath these troubling trends are substantial and increasing disparities across U.S. states (Montez et al. 2020; Wilmoth, Boe, and Barbieri 2011; Woolf and Schoomaker 2019).

Income inequality and public policy represent two such structural factors because both mirror national trends in life expectancy, are strongly tied to population health, and exhibit wide differences across states (e.g., Kaufman et al. 2020; Montez et al. 2020; Pickett and Wilkinson 2015; Venkataramani, O'Brien, and Tsai 2021).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 144}

The US Department of Energy 2016 Billion-Ton Study estimates an annual availability of 233 million tonnes (Mt) of dry waste16. To put this in perspective, the approximately 60 billion litres of corn ethanol produced in the United States in 2017 required about 150 Mt of corn (assuming a yield of 402 l ethanol per Mt). Furthermore, wastes and biomass residues can be used to derive a number of alternative energy products, including electricity along with heat, biomethane (or renewable natural gas), ethanol, renewable diesel or bio jet fuel, each through various conversion pathways, which currently are at different stages of technical and economic maturity14,15,17-21. Beyond energy production and mitigation of climate change, efficient use of wastes and residues is integral to the achievement of sustainable development22, and to redesigning our economies to minimize material and energy throughput, that is, towards becoming a circular economy23,24. However, at the same time, sustainable use of this resource hinges on overcoming some challenges. The collection, transport and storage of biomass feedstocks are costly and could account for over 50% of total cost in the supply chain of bioenergy products25. The composition of wastes also varies from one location to another, and their processing requires substantial energy inputs. In addition, national-scale policies tend to ignore local trade-offs, leading to suboptimal use of scarce resources26. Harnessing the full energetic and environmental potential of this resource, therefore, requires a holistic assessment of alternative competing pathways to their utilization taking into account the spatial distribution of each specific type of waste and the local conditions under which the wastes will be processed. The majority of previous life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies have focused on either a smaller number of waste types14,27-35, certain types of bioenergy product15,19,20,36-38 or certain conversion technologies29,31,37,39-45. Comparing the effectiveness and environmental impacts of all feasible conversion pathways for all types of waste from a systems perspective is necessary for policies that address the best use of wastes and biomass residues.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 145}

Currently, China is turning towards more sustainable development, with the deceleration of China's annual carbon emissions growth from 10% (2000-2010) to 2% (2010-2020)4. However, China remains an important driver of global carbon emissions due to its large population and growing household consumption over the past 20 years. To better explore the drivers of carbon emissions, the household carbon footprint (the sum of direct and indirect carbon emissions of household consumption along the supply chain) has received increasing attention recently1,5,6. In addition, China is one of the most populous countries in the world, with a population that is nearing its peak and aging rapidly7.

Among the studies that examine how specific state-level inclusive immigration policies impact health, the focus has primarily been on policies that extend access to public health insurance to immigrants (for notable exceptions, see Koball, Kirby, and Hartig 2022; Potochnick, May, and Flores 2019; Schut and Boen 2022). How nonhealth-related inclusive immigration policies shape the health and well-being of immigrants and their children remains far less clear. Additionally, to what extent individual inclusive policies can positively affect health independent of states' broader policy climate is also not well understood.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 152}

Yet few, if any, studies have examined the effect of a mandatory audit policy on energy use in commercial and multifamily residential buildings. This is an important omission: if information gained from the required energy audits leads property owners to invest in energy efficiency improvements that they would not otherwise implement, policymakers may be justified in expanding audit requirements to a broader range of properties and other cities may consider these requirements in their carbon-reduction-policy toolkit. A positive effect of mandatory audits on energy efficiency may also provide support for requiring more rigorous audits, including the consideration of 'deep energy retrofits', which will be necessary to achieve citywide 80%, and greater, carbon emissions reduction targets. However, if mandatory audits\u2014which can be quite costly and time-consuming for property owners, especially of smaller buildings11\u2014do not meaningfully influence behaviour or investment decisions, policymakers may do well to simply adopt an energy performance standard and allow the market to determine the optimal way to meet the requirement. Notably, in April 2019 NYC passed a law that caps the amount of fossil-fuel based energy that large buildings can consume without paying a fine12. This law, which effectively established performance standards for the buildings it covers, may obviate the need for additional mandates.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 153}

Although scholars have continued to assess the numerous ways in which climate change affects humans2,3, animals4,5 and plants6,7 on Earth, governments have been hesitant to pursue policies able to successfully reduce emissions8,9 because of a costs-participation dilemma: to be effective, climate policy must raise the price of carbon and include most countries of the world. Realizing both of these objectives is challenging because climate action is voluntary and existing studies demonstrate that publics are averse to costs10-13. A potential response to this problem is the 'ramping-up principle', that is, the idea that the price of carbon should be gradually increased to give publics time to adjust to stricter regulations8. Although intuitively appealing, it is not clear whether publics do indeed prefer increasing cost paths over alternative cost schedules or whether they simply favour climate policies with average low costs. Previous work has explored the willingness of individuals to invest in energy efficiency improvements14,15 and public approval of costly climate policy initiatives16-20. So far, there exists no systematic evidence on which intertemporal cost paths maximize public support for climate action.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 154}

While just five years ago, conventional wisdom grouped solar with the impractical and subsidy-dependent 'alternative' energy technologies, today every few months there are announcements of new largescale solar projects around the globe promising electricity prices equal to or lower than what can be achieved with fossil fuels1,2, as shown in Fig. 1a. While the well-publicized steep learning curve of photovoltaic (PV) modules3 has played a large role in bringing us to this point, other factors are now beginning to drive price reductions as modules have dropped to just over a third of total system prices, with the remainder represented by inverters, sun trackers (if used) and other components for balance of system, as well as the cost of labour and various 'soft costs' related to regulation, taxes, developer expenses and grid connection, accounted for in Fig. 1b based on data from the United States4,5. Particularly noteworthy and illustrative of this trend have been a number of announcements of low-priced utility-scale PV projects from the Middle East, especially the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia6-9, where power purchase agreement (PPA) auction bids below 3\u00a2 kWh-1 have become the norm. If sustainable, these cheap projects would represent the achievement of the US SunShot pricing goals for 203010 more than a decade ahead of schedule. As these targets represent the expectation that unsubsidized solar overtakes fossil fuels on cost, this development would have significant implications for the world's energy systems.

Residential proximity to such facilities alone, without assessed air quality, was also identified as a risk factor for asthma exacerbation17-19.

Studies of symptoms lacked objective measures and usually relied on participant diaries. Some studies overcame a portion of these limitations; for example, Smargiassi et al.16 used a case-crossover design to evaluate the relationship between SO2 concentrations and ERVs and hospitalizations among young children who lived near a refinery.

The first is the relative effectiveness of each policy type in reducing oil production and associated GHG emissions, which to date, has received limited empirical analysis10-12. The second pertains to the ancillary benefits and costs of each policy and how they are distributed across different communities. In particular, oil extraction tends to be highly spatially concentrated in certain areas, employing a local workforce and generating air pollution impacting nearby residents. Depending on how oil extraction is spatially located in relation to workers and households, different supply-side policies can have different aggregate and distributional consequences in terms of health benefits and labour-market impacts. For example, for the same overall GHG emissions target, a policy that phases out more labour-intensive oil fields may have higher lost worker compensation than other policies. Likewise, a policy that bans oil fields near where disadvantaged households reside may generate larger overall health benefits and health equity gains. Quantifying such potential consequences is critical for informing the design of supply-side policies. More broadly, there is a need to understand if and how effectiveness in GHG emissions reductions and distributional consequences trade off across different oil supply-side policies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 160}

When deployed at scale, they will be financed through public funds, reducing the fiscal space for a socially inclusive climate transition. Moreover, if the private sector owns negative emissions technologies, potentially large profits would disproportionally benefit investors and equity holders. Here we quantify the inequality repercussions of direct air capture of CO2 in a 1.5 \u00b0C scenario, using a regional integrated assessment model that features within-country income heterogeneity. We find that, under a single carbon market, financing negative emissions technologies could double the increase in income inequality of climate policy. The effects are highest around the time of net zero and in scenarios with carbon budget overshoot. We identify the drivers of the inequality increase and discuss policy provisions to mitigate the equity concerns of CO2 removal strategies.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 161}

In traditional vertically integrated systems, investors are guaranteed a rate of return by a regulatory process, which effectively shifts most risk to ratepayers and creates the incentive for excess investment. One goal behind deregulation was to encourage a more efficient allocation of this risk2. The theoretically ideal competitive market provides the basis for a second paradigm, energy-only markets. Under the energy-only design, generators earn all their revenue through the sale of energy and ancillary services. Prices rise substantially during times of scarcity, which allows generators to recover their fixed costs. In practice, a lack of price-responsive demand, combined with inconsistencies between the market clearing process and actions taken by operators on the grounds of reliability, hampered the formation of efficient scarcity prices3,4. An administrative response is to introduce an operating reserves demand curve that reflects the probability that the system operator will need to take emergency actions (for example, voltage reductions or rolling blackouts) to prevent a cascading failure5. As the probability of such actions approaches one, the price grows to an estimated value of the lost load, which is typically two orders of magnitude larger than average prices (for example, US$9,000 MWh-1 for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas). With the exception of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, wholesale market operators in the United States opted for the third paradigm. Under the ICAP design, load-serving entities are required to either supply or procure an administratively determined level of capacity. Energy prices in these markets are capped at a much lower level (for example, US$2,000 MWh-1 or lower), and revenue from the sale of energy and ancillary services is supplemented by payments for capacity. The intent of these capacity payments is to balance the 'missing money' that results from the cap and other price-suppressing actions to restore the outcomes that would be achieved in an ideal energy-only market6-8.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 164}

Second, the extent to which physical health is affected by witnessing or experiencing interpersonal violence while detained has received scant attention in the quantitative empirical research. This is an important omission because periods of confinement often involve unwanted, uncontrollable, and threatening experiences that conceivably govern the effects of incarceration on postrelease health (Porter 2019). As such, prior work has largely considered incarceration a homogeneous experience, thus ignoring the effects of varied experiences.

This might be partly because the costs of mitigation are incurred domestically and immediately, whereas most of its benefits will be reaped globally and in the future. In addition, more ambitious climate action might be hindered by concerns about the limited effectiveness of nations' domestic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if other countries do not do make similar changes. This consideration is especially pertinent in relatively small countries. Indeed, in 2021 the smallest 90% of emitters contributed only about 20% of global GHG emissions. Such a narrow perspective, however, neglects the fact that international leadership in climate change mitigation can yield substantial benefits beyond domestic emission reductions1,2. For example, stringent climate policies at home can support the international diffusion of technological innovations that reduce mitigation costs in other countries3,4. Furthermore, domestic climate policies can show the political feasibility and certain benefits of carbon pricing5, and they can create incentives related to trade6 and diplomacy7 that can nudge other countries to adopt the same or similar policies.

First, appropriation of edible crops for biofuel (mainly corn and sugarcane for ethanol, and soybean, canola and palm for biodiesel) was an important factor responsible for food price inflation alongside other factors such as rising income that drove rapid growth in food demand (especially meat demand), rising energy prices, adverse weather shocks, currency fluctuations and trade policies1,3-6, the consequences of which were particularly severe for poorer households in developing countries7.

Women experience a higher incidence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, depression, and disability compared to men (Case and Paxson 2005; Leveille et al. 2000; Nolen-Hoeksema 2001), and rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States have increased over the past several decades (Creanga et al. 2014). Women also experience more barriers to health care access (Ng et al. 2010; Rustgi, Doty, and Collins 2009), which may exacerbate gender gaps in health. Women are more likely to be adversely affected by barriers to health care access, in part, because women have greater need for health care services to manage chronic conditions and reproductive care (Case and Paxson 2005; Doyal 2000; Owens 2008).

Additionally, hydrogen is a promising candidate for long-duration energy storage of renewables8,9 and the precursor to all electrofuels10, which are highly versatile yet costly11. Consequently, policy measures to stimulate the ramp-up of the hydrogen market are gaining momentum as more than 40 governments have already adopted hydrogen strategies1,7. Prominent examples are the supply-side subsidies implemented through the the US Inflation Reduction Act12 and the EU Hydrogen Bank13. Such policy support is urgently required: to meet the median ambition in 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios, namely, 350 GW by 2030, green hydrogen production needs to grow 380-fold, more than doubling each year.

Removing fossil fuel subsidies is crucial not only for reducing CO2 emissions and making carbon pricing more effective, but also for making more valuable use of government funds. Currently, however, scientific evidence on the scale and scope of public attitudes towards  fossil fuel subsidy-removal policies is lacking, yet it is instrumental for gauging political feasibility. Furthermore, previous studies tend to focus  on carbon pricing in the developed world only. Here we present a comparative analysis of attitudes towards both carbon taxation and fossil fuel subsidy removal, focusing on five developing countries across four continents. It is found that (1) removing fossil fuel subsidies is not more undesirable than introducing carbon taxation and (2) the public has more-positive attitudes towards subsidy removal if optimal use of the saved f iscal revenues is specified.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 176}

Pregnant substance users are uniquely exposed to competing medical and legal responses while receiving pregnancyrelated health care. Despite recent, louder prescriptions to treat addiction as a disease (Pew Research Center 2014), pregnant and postpartum substance users continue to experience extraclinical interventions such as criminal prosecution and child welfare interventions (Paltrow and Flavin 2013). State mandatory reporting laws and child abuse statutes that codify substance use during pregnancy as child maltreatment create a statutory environment that empowers practitioners to investigate their patients for suspected illegal activity. Recent estimates indicate that tens of thousands of women a year are subject to child welfare investigations after medical staff identify and report them to the state for prenatal substance use (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2021).1 This article examines the blending of medical and legal approaches in perinatal care through an analysis of medical professionals' justifications and rationales for drug testing pregnant patients. Expanding current understandings of the relationship between medicalization and criminalization processes, this study reveals the mechanisms that enable medical providers to engage in investigatory work in the clinic. I also discuss the consequences of medico-legal hybridity, whereby criminal-legal logics get taken up in medical practice in such a way that medical routines, practices, and interactions become a form of criminalization.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 178}

The IMF began to emphasize subsidy reform in its policy recommendations10. Subsidy reforms were directly incorporated into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 12.c) in September 2015, and 15 countries included fossil fuel subsidy reforms in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions for the December 2015 Paris conference11. It is unclear whether these initiatives led to a reduction in subsidies. One study found that, from 2015 to 2020, 41 countries reformed consumer fossil fuel subsidies12; yet, according to the International Energy Agency, from 2015 to 2022 these subsidies rose from US$183 billion to US$343 billion (ref. 13). The reform of fossil fuel subsidies is difficult to study in part because they are hard to measure. In many countries, subsidies rise and fall over time owing to a mixture of market forces and government policies that can be hard to disentangle. Governments often provide unreliable information about their own policies: they may announce reforms but fail to implement them or, conversely, adopt reforms quietly in an effort to avoid protests.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 179}

These questions are aimed at deriving both general insights on the optimal use of wastes and biomass residues, and also illustrating their overall climate-change mitigation potential in the context of a large country, specifically the United States. To this end, we quantify life-cycle GHG emissions and net energy gain for 15 conversion pathways (detailed description in Table 1) and 29 waste feedstocks with spatially explicit estimates of waste potential for the United States. We find that the source of electricity consumed during processing and the environmental footprint of the displaced products are key in determining the best use of wastes and biomass residues. The utilization of all available wastes and residues in the contiguous United States can generate 3.1-3.8 EJ of renewable energy, but deliver only 2.4-3.2 EJ of net energy gain, and displace 103-178 Mt of CO2-equivalent (MtCO2 e) GHG emissions. For any given waste feedstock, looking across all US counties where it is available, except in rare instances, no single conversion pathway simultaneously maximizes renewable energy production, net energy gain and GHG mitigation.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 180}

For example, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy screenings are important tools in reducing deaths from colorectal cancer (Brenner, Stock, and Hoffmeister 2014), flu shots decrease the risk of serious illness if infected (Ferdinands et al. 2021), and COVID-19 vaccinations prevented an estimated 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths worldwide during the first year of use (Watson et al. 2022). \u201cPreventive care\u201d generally includes spending on programs for public health information, education, and counseling; immunization, early disease detection, and healthy condition monitoring programs (e.g., for monitoring pregnancy, child growth and development, general health checkups); epidemiological surveillance; and emergency preparedness and disaster response (Kamal and Hudman 2020). Despite the clear health benefits preventive care offers, the majority of U.S. adults do not receive all recommended clinical preventive services (Borsky et al. 2018).

A growing body of research identifies structural sexism as a driver of population health, but it remains unknown if structural sexism is linked to preventive care use and, if so, whether the relationship differs for women and men. Gender performance and gendered power and resource allocation perspectives lead to competing hypotheses regarding these questions. This study explores the relationship between structural sexism and preventive care in gender-stratified, multilevel models that combine data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System with state-level data (N = 425,454). We find that in states with more structural sexism, both men and women were less likely to seek preventive care.

However, these efforts are hindered by poor knowledge of the interactions between policies. Here we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of China (CEEGE model) and create a policy portfolio area of 1,295 scenarios covering four major mitigation strategies (carbon pricing, energy efficiency, renewable energy and electrification of end uses). When the interactions between mitigation policies are considered, the percentage of scenarios in which the carbon neutrality target is reached by 2060 decreases by 84%, with the years in which these scenarios are achieved being delayed by 5-6 years. Only the combinations with renewable energy and electrification of end uses generate synergetic effects on both economic and mitigation impacts.

However, residual emissions are typically not well defined, conceptually or quantitatively. We analysed governments' long-term strategies submitted to the UNFCCC to explore projections of residual emissions, including amounts and sectors. We found substantial levels of residual emissions at net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, on average 18% of current emissions for Annex I countries. The majority of strategies were imprecise about which sectors residual emissions would originate from, and few offered specific projections of how residual emissions could be balanced by carbon removal. Our findings indicate the need for a consistent definition of residual emissions, as well as processes that standardize and compare expectations about residual emissions across countries. This is necessary for two reasons: to avoid projections of excessive residuals and correspondent unsustainable or unfeasible carbon-removal levels and to send clearer signals about the temporality of fossil fuel use.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 185}

Wu et al.6 provide a power grid simulation to conduct a very detailed analysis of the 2021 event, and Doss-Gollin et al.7 have shown that lower temperatures than those in February 2021 have been observed in the past 71 years, and heating demand predicted from temperature data would also have been higher in the past, although the 2021 freeze event was comparably long. These previous studies indicate a striking gap between the occurrence probability of such an event, its large-scale economic and social cost and the lack of winterization efforts. However, none of these studies assessed whether the economic incentives for power companies to invest in winterization have been sufficient, when the 2021 event is put into a long-term climatic context. As winterization was not strongly enforced by regulation in Texas, power generators had to rely on the incentives provided by the energy-only market to arrive at investment decisions.

This is an important oversight, as many of the arguments that there are trade-offs between climate action and poverty alleviation or other SDGs depend on the premise that climate action must harm the current poor25,26. Indeed, because the possibility of progressive revenue recycling is not taken into account in existing optimal climate policy calculations, these models have a built-in bias against mitigation, since they imply that mitigation must entail costs for the poorest citizens within regions in the coming decades and, more generally, imply an intergenerational trade-off in well-being27,28.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 196}

However, in democratic countries, such policies may face public opposition. While several studies suggest that the global energy transition (that is, shifting from non-renewable to renewable energies) is likely to lead to net job creation in most economies8, the closure of coal mines and coal-fired power plants may lead to temporary and regionally concentrated job losses. The anticipation of negative employment effects could lead to opposition by those working in the sector9. Moreover, the coal industry has become an identity-shaping symbol deeply engrained in the culture of some communities and countries, such as in the German region of Lusatia10, Silesia in Poland11 or Appalachia in the United States12. Opposition to a phase-out of coal is also likely to be fuelled by the economic actors that have to bear parts of the costs, such as utilities whose business models depend on coal, and labour unions representing coal workers. Given their desire to be re-elected, democratic governments may be responsive to these concerns.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 197}

This study evaluates one approach to discouraging development in risky areas\u2014eliminating public incentives for development, such as infrastructure investments, disaster assistance and federal flood insurance. Using machine learning and matching techniques, we examine the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS), a set of lands where these federal incentives have been removed. We find that the policy leads to lower development densities inside designated areas, increases development in neighbouring areas, reduces flood damages and alters local demographics. Our results suggest that the CBRS generates substantial savings for the federal government by reducing flood claims in the National Flood Insurance Program, while increasing the property tax base in coastal counties.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 198}

Calls for a just transition necessarily recognize that new energy systems will be built on and potentially reproduce the winners and losers of existing energy systems3. Within current energy systems, groups at the spatial periphery are at high risk of having their energy needs under-recognized and procedurally neglected4,5. Many communities hosting new renewable energy developments, particularly Indigenous communities, face procedural injustices in the form of limited access to decision-making procedures for developments on their lands6-8. There is a need to better understand the spatial and socio-demographic characteristics of communities facing non-recognition in protections afforded by present day electricity retail regulations, wherein non-recognition refers to the needs of certain groups being neglected or ignored4.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 199}
