This is twice as much as the cost of excluding solar power and similar to the cost of excluding wind power, despite both of them cost optimally providing more primary energy (Fig. 2d,e). Excluding any of these primary energy sources thus leads to much higher costs. Wind and solar power are more readily interchangeable whereas the substitution of biomass is much more expensive because biomass provides non-fossil carbon in addition to energy, for which the substitute, DAC, coupled with a necessary expansion of additional energy provision, ends up much more expensive.

Different to studies limited to the power system only, which indicate a substantially larger firm generation energy requirement8, or IAM studies, which often obtain substantial biomass use for electricity production36, this study finds lower levels of bioelectricity use because the sector-coupled model entails large flexible demand capacities such as electrolysers, heat storage, batteries and electric vehicles, which handle most of the variability in the power system and thus support high VRE shares (Fig. 3).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Even though dispatchable biomethane supplies only around 1 % of electricity, it is the hardest biomass service to substitute when biomass availability is reduced.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 42}

Capturing biogenic CO2 emissions enhances carbon utilization, enabling scarce renewable carbon to be used multiple times and to provide negative emissions.

Similarly, of the projects announced in 2022, only 3% were realized on time, with 76% delayed and 21% disappearing (Fig. 3c). Projects in the feasibility study or concept stage almost always had a success rate of zero, implying that projects announced without a final investment decision (FID) in 2021 or 2022 were never realized on time in 2023 (Fig. 3b,c).

The high failure rates in 2022 and 2023 may be attributed to supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19, surging electricity prices during the European energy crisis and rising global interest rates. However, in Europe, the energy crisis was also seen as an opportunity to accelerate green hydrogen deployment, although this has yet to materialize (Supplementary Fig. 9). Considering the project announcements for 2024, it remains questionable whether the more than 12\u200b\u200bGW currently announced will be realized on time (Supplemen\u200btary Fig. 6). Although nearly 5\u200b\u200bGW (40%) has already achieved an FID or is under construction, this was also the case for project announcements made in 2022 for 2023, of which only 8% were completed on schedule (Fig. 3c).

Startups with at\nleast one corporate investment exited at a rate 110% higher than those\nwithout corporate investment (hazard ratio = 2.10). Similarly, startups\nwith at least one investment from other private investors exited at a\nrate 150% higher than those without such investments (hazard ratio =\n2.50). Each additional patent held by a startup was associated with a 2%\nincrease in rate of exits, whereas being headquartered in a climate-tech\n\u2018hotspot\u2019 location was associated with a 23% increase in exit rate. For\nthe same population of startups, corporate investment was associated\nwith a 62% increase in rate of failure, and other private investment\nwas associated with a 265% increase in rate of failure. While startups\nare high-risk investments where most will fail, and thus correlation\nwith failure is not necessarily surprising, the lower hazard of failure\nfor corporate investment compared with other private investment\nsources may indicate a role for corporations in providing more patient\ncapital. Public grants, patents and startup location were not found to\nbe significantly associated with failure.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Corporate investment is associated with roughly double the likelihood of exit compared with startups that do not receive corporate funding.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 80}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Figure 3 shows our modelling results on the impact of reforms and actors\u2019 foresight on carbon prices (see also Extended Data Figs. 1\u20136). First of all, one can see between period (1) and period (2), when the MSR reform was negotiated and implemented, actors presumably started to look further into the future. When turning to period (1) before 2018, one notices that observed ETS prices are closer to the modelled prices for myopic actors than to the modelled prices for farsighted actors. It seems therefore plausible to assume that market actors behaved at least partially myopically, which is in line with earlier assessments7. For periods (2) and (3), one observes the opposite: both, the 2019\u20132020 observed ETS prices of \u20ac20\u201330 tCO2\u22121 and the 2021\u20132022 ones of \u20ac70\u201390 tCO2\u22121, are consistent with the modelled prices for farsighted actors (that is, perfect foresight trajectories for old \u2018MSR reform\u2019 targets, and new \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 targets, respectively). We also calculate the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) between the modelled and historical prices (Extended Data Tables 1\u20134), which confirms the visual conclusions drawn from Fig. 3.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Observed carbon prices after 2018 match the trajectories generated by the farsighted-actor model better than those from the myopic-actor model.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 90}

The capacity spin up of LIMES-EU is fixed so that it matches the 2015 historical mix of installed generation capacities in EU ETS countries. Extended Data Fig. 5 illustrates that based on this standing capacity, the model-calculated dispatch then reasonable matches the historic power generation dispatch in EU ETS countries. The total modelled emissions from electricity generation in the year 2015 for EU ETS countries covered by LIMES-EU amount to 981\u2009Mt\u2009CO2, closely aligning with the historical emissions of 967\u2009Mt\u2009CO2 reported by Mantsos et al.56 Because emissions from industry, heating and aviation are also calibrated to match their historical 2015 levels (as described in LIMES-EU documentation52), this calibration ensures that our model generates meaningful values for total emissions in the 2015 time step. Also, the model-endogenous investments in 2015 lead to standing capacities in 2020 that match historic wind and solar capacities in 2020. To this aim, we additionally assume subsidies for electricity generated from solar or wind sources (\u20ac0.04\u2009kWh\u22121 for solar and \u20ac0.015\u2009kWh\u22121 for wind) to represent the various renewable subsidies that were in place in most EU member states.

We observe rapid and consistent cost reductions per annum (p.a.), with similar patterns for all source categories. We find cost reductions (CRs) of around 5% p.a. (scientific and others) to 6.5% p.a. (near market) until 2030 and 3.3\u20134.5% p.a. over an extended 2020\u20132050 period.

Unlike for battery and FC costs, we find less substantial CR potentials for the adjacent ZET components using the same method, albeit with smaller samples and less detail (Supplementary Figs. 14\u201317). Precisely, costs for electric motors probably fall from beyond \u20ac202042\u2009kW\u22121 by 2020 to \u20ac202030\u2009kW\u22121 by 2050 (\u22121.2% p.a.).

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Our analysis of battery cost predictions unveils that near-market estimates are remarkably stable over different release dates. These projections are prone to only minor downward adjustments, as indicated by the difference between OLS and WLS results (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 and Supplementary Table 2), and are consistently more optimistic than those from scientific literature (p\u2009<\u20090.05, two-tailed t-test; Supplementary Table 4). Conversely, scientific cost estimates published in 2010\u20132023 faced substantial downward adjustments. Hence, battery costs have experienced a more rapid decline than initially expected, at least in the scientific community. This echoes Nykvist and Nilsson25, who found similar divergences for industry vs market leaders vs peer-reviewed literature estimates and supports conclusions from Frith et al.32, who emphasize substantial gaps between academic and industry perspectives. One explanation might be that near-market sources may have more practical in-depth knowledge about technologies, manufacturing or cost-saving measures and better access to industry insights such as market trends, partnerships, supply chain dynamics or confidential pricing data. In contrast, parts of the scientific literature may be classified as theoretical estimates or may be affected by citation patterns or time-delaying review processes, leading to the self-confirmation of outdated values and assumptions.\n\nHowever, FC system costs exhibit an inverse trend. Scientific estimates show higher stability and are consistently more optimistic (p\u2009<\u20090.05, two-tailed t-test; Supplementary Table 5) than near-market estimates.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    For battery costs, scientific publications are generally less optimistic than near-market sources, whereas for fuel cells the opposite pattern is observed.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 103}

Using a recent TCO framework56 along with our cost projections, we find that BETs may realize cost benefits versus DTs as of today. In contrast, FCETs may struggle to reach TCO parity throughout the 2030s because green hydrogen prices remain probably too high. Herein the share of acquisition costs substantially rises for ZETs compared with current DTs, whereas energy storage size, energy prices and mileage are the most sensitive parameters (Methods and Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The analysis concludes that battery-electric trucks can already achieve total cost of ownership advantages over diesel trucks, while fuel-cell trucks will not reach parity until well into the 2030s.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 104}

Several facts underpin the feasibility of the derived costs despite potential non-negligible disruptions caused by raw material shortages, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation levels, increased energy costs or raw material shortages42\u201344, whereof the latter\u2019s effect would depend on the specific chemistry. Calculated system- and cell-level costs do not fall below original scientific or near-market estimates and announced industry values, as could have happened by the regression. For example, the European Battery Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)45 targets system costs of around \u20ac202075\u2009kWh\u22121 by 2025 and even below by 2030 and beyond.

The projected ready-to-drive prime costs of the first generation 500-mile Tesla Semi truck, equipped with these cells and suspected 800\u2013900\u2009kWh, stand at roughly US$200,000 in 202346, indicating associated battery system costs below US$150\u2009kWh\u22121.

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    In comparison to setbacks on only new wells, applying setbacks \nadditionally to existing wells predictably results in greater oil-production declines and emis-\nsions reductions. As discussed earlier, setbacks applied to only new wells result in a continuous decline in oil production and GHG emissions (Fig. 6). In contrast, setbacks applied to all wells induce an immediate drop in statewide oil production and associated GHG emissions in 2020 as existing wells within the setback distance fall out of production. This drop is then followed by a gradual decline thereafter that tracks \nthe BAU trajectory. Oil production and GHG emissions reductions \nincrease as setbacks get longer. Although a 1-mile setback, the largest \nconsidered in this study, applied to all wells achieves a substantially \ngreater GHG emissions reduction (81%) by 2045 compared with the \nsame setback on new wells (72%), it still falls short of meeting the 90% \nreduction target (Fig. 6b). However, the cumulative GHG emissions \nreduction over 2020\u20132045 for the 1-mile setback applied to all wells is \non par with those of excise and carbon taxes that result in a 90% annual \nGHG emissions reduction in 2045 (Fig. 2c).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    A 1-mile setback applied to both existing and new wells is projected to cut GHG emissions by about 81 %, compared with roughly 72 % when the same setback applies only to new wells.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 136}

The higher prices \ncould also result in lower average per capita final cooking energy \ndemand under the climate mitigation policy scenarios as compared \nwith the reference scenarios and a much smaller proportion of gas \nin the cooking energy mix.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Climate mitigation policies are expected to raise average per-capita cooking energy demand because households will substitute electricity for gas.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 173}

In developed regions, there is little change in the ref-\nerence scenarios as there is little transition in fuels over time, and \npopulation and urbanization remain quite stable. In emerging and \ndeveloping regions, for example, CPA, income growth and urban-\nization result in shifts from less efficient to more efficient fuels, but \npopulation shifts could mean relatively little change in total cooking \nenergy demand. On the other hand, in AFR, total cooking energy \ndemand could increase over time on account of rapid population \ngrowth and a slow transition away from polluting stoves.

We thus analysed the remaining categories jointly. The individual category aesthetics comprises 9% of the total number of turbines and 7% of the total capacity dismantled. However, aesthetics also play a role in three mixed categories (aesthetics or noise, politics or aesthetics and politics, aesthetics or noise). Assuming that all the turbines in these three categories were removed because of aesthetics, it would become the second most pronounced reason, comprising 21% of the total number of turbines and 20% of the total capacity dismantled.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Aesthetic concerns alone were responsible for the majority of turbine removals in Denmark\u2019s repowering projects.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 197}

For high users, normative and injunctive feedbacks pull behaviour in the same direction, which results in a reduction in electricity almost twice as large as that in the average treatment effect. For low electricity users, conforming to the reference groups\u2019 behaviour motivates a consumption increase (\u2019boomerang\u2019), but the injunctive feedback included in the eHER counterbalances the negative effect of the descriptive feedback. The injunctive feedback therefore induces stronger behavioural reactions among high electricity users, who are also exposed to the supporting descriptive feedback, than that among low electricity users, for whom the two types of feedback are at odds. Although such an interpretation is only suggestive based on the evidence presented so far, it shows how established findings are consistent with our conceptual framework.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    High-consumption households reduced their electricity usage by roughly twice the programme\u2019s average effect when exposed to the standard social-information message.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 202}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    To determine whether the overall effect of crossing the three versus two thumbs-up threshold is exclusively due to the presence within the eHER of the descriptive prime, we performed the RD estimation on a standard eHER (February\u2013March 2018). We found statistically significant effects (coefficient\u2009=\u2009\u22120.855, s.e.\u2009=\u20090.368, P\u2009=\u20090.02; Table 2, column 1). Therefore, the effect of reinforcing the injunctive feedback for low users does not depend on the presence of the descriptive prime within the report. In addition, we observe that the overall effect of crossing the three versus two thumbs-up threshold within the standard report is smaller than the same effect when the report is augmented with the descriptive prime (coefficient\u2009=\u2009\u22122.426, s.e.\u2009=\u20090.619, P\u2009<\u20090.01; Table 1, column 3). This confirms that the combination of consistent descriptive and injunctive information boosts the effectiveness of social information in inducing energy conservation.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Adding a descriptive prime amplifies the consumption drop associated with moving from two to three thumbs up compared with the standard report without the prime.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 206}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Our results are in line with these hypotheses. First, we found suggestive evidence that the standard social information message induces larger savings among high electricity users who are exposed to consistent descriptive and injunctive feedback, compared with low electricity users who are exposed to contrasting descriptive and injunctive feedback. More importantly, reinforcing the injunctive feedback has the largest effect among low electricity users exposed to a consistent descriptive prime. These findings are in line with the notion that injunctive and descriptive feedbacks have a larger impact on electricity conservation when they pull behaviour in the same rather than in opposite directions. Second, reinforcing the injunctive feedback led to a reduction in consumption, but only among customers with low electricity usage. This shows that the relative strengths of the different types of feedback matters when they are contrasting. Such a reinforcement has no effect on customers with high consumption. This demonstrates the limited effect of reinforcing one type of normative feedback within a message that already contains two consistent pieces of normative information of different types. This is further confirmed by the finding that reinforcing the injunctive feedback has no effect among users exposed to a consistent injunctive prime. Together these findings suggest that additional pieces of feedback have a larger impact when they pull behaviour in the same direction and are of different types. Overall, our results support the presence of synergies between different types of feedback rather than the primacy of any one type of feedback.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Reinforcing the injunctive feedback produced the greatest reduction in electricity use among high-consumption households.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 209}

We find energy use reductions of approximately \u20132.5% for multifamily residential buildings and \u20134.9% for office buildings. The results suggest that mandatory audits, by themselves, create an insufficient incentive to invest in energy efficiency at the scale needed to meet citywide carbon-reduction goals.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Mandatory audits were linked to about a 2.5 % decrease in energy use for multifamily buildings.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 240}

Many others were marketed nationally, but through community energy networks rather than general alternative finance online platforms. There is a clear gap between the scale of funds raised by these different mechanisms, with general large-scale marketing raising the largest sums (see Table 5). However, our data show that local marketing has the lowest mean interest rates, with rates on average 0.8% lower than energy-specific UK-wide marketing (a significant difference at the 1% significance level). It is also notable that locally marketed community shares raised enough to cover project CAPEX for 32 of the 43 projects in the table (74% of these projects).

However, we do have up to five years of data for general customers, and for these users we do not find a discernible increase in LPG cylinder purchases over this interval (Fig. 5). The median refill rates and distribution of refills remain nearly constant over this period.

We find that a standard deviation (s.d.) increase in distributor (up-front) price reduces normalized monthly sales by 0.27 s.d. We also see a comparable effect of seasonal factors in explaining the variation in refill sales. A shift from \u2018no cropping\u2019 season to cropping or harvest season increases monthly refill sales by 0.22 or 0.26\u2009s.d. respectively, everything else remaining equal. Refill rates in summer, when agricultural activity is limited, are ~10% lower than rates during cropping and harvest seasons when people are busy with agricultural work. During the cropping season, people are busy preparing fields, planting and weeding. They place a high value on their time and meals tend to be quick, which is conducive to cooking with LPG. Later, during the harvest season, people have cash in hand, making LPG purchases easier33.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Regression analysis showed that moving from the no-cropping season to the harvest season was associated with roughly a 0.26 standard-deviation rise in normalized monthly LPG sales.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 278}

It is clear that the energy value of coproducts is critical to achieving positive net energy for a number of conversion pathways and waste feedstocks. Except for animal-manure-related pathways, all conversion pathways result in positive net energy gains and considerable energy return on investment. For animal manure, only anaerobic digestion (M2) yields positive net energy, and its energy return on investment is only slightly greater than 1.

For municipal solid waste (MSW), CHP offers the highest net energy gain while anaerobic digestion returns more climate benefits than other pathways. When compared with current management practices, all conversion pathways result in climate benefits for agricultural residues. For animal manure, only anaerobic digestion producing either methane (M2) or electricity and heat (E4) yields climate benefits. This corresponds to previous studies, which indicate that anaerobic digestion is the optimal conversion pathway for animal manure15,27,28. Although some pathways appear not to contribute to climate-change mitigation (that is, result in positive net GWP), all conversion pathways for forest residues yield smaller net GWP relative to burning them on site. When compared with landfilling without any methane flaring or capture, all conversion pathways for MSW result in smaller negative effects on the climate. However, landfilling with methane capture and on-site CHP would greatly reduce the GHG emissions of landfilling and become more attractive than renewable-diesel-related conversion pathways (Fig. 1c,d).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    For agricultural residues, the combined heat and power pathway provides both the largest net energy gain and the greatest greenhouse-gas benefit.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 282}

For cleaner power grids, electricity-related pathways would on one hand result in lower emissions during the processing stage, but on the other hand lead to less climate benefit from the displacement of grid electricity. For the majority of non-electricity pathways, electricity is only an input, so cleaner power grids would result in lower emissions during the processing stage and the overall life cycle. For instance, whereas converting agricultural and forest residues into electricity through CHP (E1) and into biomethane through gasification (M1) appear equally beneficial under current conditions, M1 becomes more beneficial when power grids are cleaner. Another sensitivity analysis on transportation distance was also conducted (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, a distance ranging from 25 to 150\u2009km negligibly affects results on GHG emissions.

The national results are the aggregation of county-level results. The calculations are described in Methods and results are depicted in Table 3 and Fig. 3.

As one would expect, MEP results in the highest potential of renewable energy production, which totals 3.8\u2009EJ\u20143.7% of total US energy demand in 2016 (ref. 46), and MER results in the highest potential of emissions reduction, 178\u2009MtCO2e\u20142.7% of total US GHG emissions in 2016 (ref. 47).

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    For agricultural residues, current management practice (that is, left and decayed on field) entail no GWP due to the fact that the GWPbio index for annual crops is zero. While the same GWPbio index applies to animal feed, methane and N2O emissions from animal farm operations contribute to total emissions from direct land application of manure. For MSW, the major sources of non-biogenic carbon are contained in plastics, rubber and leather, and textiles. For non-electricity pathways, non-biogenic carbon in MSW feedstocks would be transferred into energy products and eventually be emitted into the atmosphere as CO2 during end use. This explains a large amount of emissions during the end-use stage for these pathways. For electricity-related pathways (E1\u2013E4), non-biogenic carbon would be emitted as CO2 during the processing phase. For other types of MSW feedstock, biogenic carbon would be emitted as biogenic CO2 in various phases. Thus, we treated biogenic CO2 as a separate source of GHG emissions.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study concludes that non-electricity pathways completely prevent non-biogenic carbon in municipal solid waste from being released as CO2.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 289}

For the timing attribute, we take 2040 as the ref-\nerence category, as this level most closely matches the 2038 time-\nline ultimately recommended by the Coal Commission. We find \nthat policy scenarios with 2025 as an end date have a significantly \nhigher probability of being supported than policies with later end \ndates. Postponing the phase-out to 2040 leads to a decrease in policy \nsupport of 10.7 percentage points, and postponing it to 2100\u2014as \nreflected in the G7\u2019s statement to phase out fossil fuels by the end \nof the century\u2014leads to a decrease in policy support of 15.3 per-\ncentage points, compared with the 2040 baseline. As is apparent in \nthe data, Germans are also sensitive to the cost of a coal phase-out. \nEvery increase in annual cost of \u20ac10 per household (or about \u20ac400 \nmillion per year for the German economy as a whole) decreases \npublic support by about seven percentage points. With regard to \nemployment effects, people prefer scenarios with lower job losses \nover scenarios with higher job losses, but they value newly created \njobs slightly higher than lost old jobs. For instance, while the sce-\nnario with 20,000 lost jobs decreases phase-out support by 9.2 per-\ncentage points compared with a scenario with only 5,000 lost jobs, \ncreating the same number of new jobs increases phase-out support \nby 12.2 percentage points.

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    In addition to the option and futures contracts used in the pre- vious example, we define a unit contingent contract that matches the availability of the variable generator40. The interaction between availability and demand in determining the occurrence of scar- city conditions means it is difficult to determine in advance which combinations of random variable realizations will represent the worst-case scenarios for market participants. However, the intent is to structure one contract that matches the risk profile of each technology: futures to the baseload technology, options to the peak- ing technology and unit contingent to the variable technology. The equilibrium results are split into two tables, oriented in order of increasing surplus. Table 4 shows the capacity mix that arises when at most one trade is available. Comparing the bold cells within each row, it can be seen that introducing any of the trades individually results in more capacity of the corresponding technology. The  market share of the baseload unit collapses after the introduction of the  unit contingent contract. As in the two-generator example, intro- duction of the option contract (analogous to current capacity mar- kets) results in a complete exit of the baseload technology.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    When only the option contract is introduced in the three-generator model, the baseload technology disappears from the equilibrium capacity mix.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 316}

Around 60% of this \ndecline is due to lower technology cost (CAPEX) with the remain-\ning 40% due to lower financing cost. Three effects contribute to \nthe change in financing costs. First, the initial investment to be \nfinanced (CAPEX) decreased, which lowers the financing cost. \nSecond, the general interest rate decreased. Third, an experience \neffect led to the compression of financing margins. The three \neffects differ in importance between the two studied technologies. \nThe large reduction in solar PV CAPEX during the period of our \nstudy (see Supplementary Table 4) led to lower financing costs, \nwhich contributed roughly one-third (36%) of LCOE reductions. \nConversely, onshore wind CAPEX stayed relatively constant (see \nSupplementary Table 4), increasing the relative importance of the \ngeneral interest rate effect, which contributed one-fifth (20%) of \nLCOE reductions. Thus, the channels through which financing \ncosts contribute to lowering LCOEs vary according to the relative \nreductions in CAPEX. As solar PV and wind onshore are becom-\ning mature technologies and future CAPEX reductions become less \nlikely, the relative importance of the general interest rate and expe-\nrience effects will increase.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    For solar PV, reductions in general interest rates accounted for roughly one-third of the overall LCOE reduction observed in the study period.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 327}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Figure 1 shows box plots of the change (in %) of the annual net-\nwork expenditures under the 11 tariff scenarios compared with \nthe reference scenario for the 765 households (for analysis of the \nsubsample see Supplementary Fig. 1). Several outcomes are evi-\ndent: first, the most significant change in households\u2019 network \nexpenditures are calculated for scenarios with a dominant share of \nfixed or peak-load charges and thereby deviate significantly from \nthe reference scenario. The interpretation works vice versa, that is, \none would observe similar changes in household network costs if, \nsay, f100 was currently applied and was substituted for the reference \nscenario.\n\nSecond, the box plots reveal that for some households the \nincreased costs in certain tariff scenarios are very high compared \nwith reference levels. For illustration, we marked the two house-\nholds that experience the highest increase in network expenditures \nunder peak-based scenarios by open and filled triangles. These are \nsingle-person households that consume moderate volumes of elec-\ntricity (that is, 1,805 and 1,604\u2009kWh in total during the observation \nperiod) and their current network costs in the reference scenario \nare low compared with the mean in our sample. At the same time, \nthese households produce massive peak loads (see Supplementary \nFigs. 2 and 3). Consequently, under tariff schemes charging exclu-\nsively for measured peak demand, such as pa100, they have to pay \nup to \u20ac\u200b435.40 and \u20ac\u200b471.60 more, translating to +\u200b422% and +\u200b499%, \nrespectively. In contrast to their sensitivity to tariffs, which empha-\nsize measured peak demand, the same two households face only \naround 80% higher charges in scenario f100. When neglecting peak \ndemand and applying scenario e100, which is determined by the \nvolume of consumed energy only, the opposite effect occurs and \nthese households would actually pay around 10% less than in the \nreference scenario.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study found that the two highlighted single-person households would face increases of roughly 422\u2013499 % under the pa100 peak-demand tariff compared with the reference tariff.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 340}

The E policy supports the substitution of electricity for fossil fuels by encouraging end-use sectors to adjust energy consumption preferences and increase electricity demand; in contrast, the R policy increases the proportion of green electricity by reducing the cost of renewable electricity generation in the overall electricity mix. On the economic cost side, the R policy promotes low-cost renewable electricity and mitigates the economic cost. Even though the E policy increases the cost of electricity production due to its expanded scale, the R policy helps mitigate the economic impact.

On average, NDCs met 2 out of 11 characteristics (s.d.\u2009=\u20092.9, N\u2009=\u200912) and NAPs met 5 (s.d.\u2009=\u20093.5, N\u2009=\u200910) (Extended Data Table 1). Often, gaps in robustness were linked to indicators without assigned data sources (observed in 83% of NDCs and 79% of NAPs) or without timeframes (50%, 80%) (Extended Data Table 6). Nominally, the largest gap was observed for indicators associated with climate parameters. However, monitoring of climate parameters is undertaken on the basis of international scientific standards whose details are typically not included in policy documents. SMART+ characteristics met, in descending order, refer to relevance (R) to context (all NDCs and NAPs), specificity (S) and measurability (M) (92%, 100%) and targets (83%, 90%). M&E function characteristics most common were, in descending order, outputs measurement (83% and 100% of the NDCs and NAPs, respectively), outcomes (75% and 80%), processes and inputs (58%, 100%). NDCs of Ethiopia and Rwanda and Madagascar\u2019s NAP had highest robustness scores (0.8). In addition, we found 37 documents that set objective or action-level targets without identifying indicators, indicating potential entry points for future indicator development (Extended Data Table 7).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    None of the analysed NDCs or NAPs satisfied every robustness characteristic defined by the study.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 414}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Across both categories of removals, a CDR gap already emerges by 2030 (Table 2). Compared with 2011\u20132020, the conditional NDCs would expand CDR by \u22120.5\u2009GtCO2\u2009yr\u22121 in 2030. This contrasts with an increase of \u22121\u2009GtCO2\u2009yr\u22121 in 2030 in the Focus on demand reduction scenario, which has the lowest CDR requirements. The CDR gap in 2050 is then strongly determined by the chosen scenario benchmark. Compared with 2020, additional CDR in 2050 implied by the upper estimate of the long-term mitigation strategies (from 28 countries including the EU, assuming all others sustain current removals) would sum to \u22121.9\u2009GtCO2\u2009yr\u22121. This approaches levels in the Focus on demand reduction scenario (an additional \u22122.3\u2009GtCO2\u2009yr\u22121), but falls short by multiple gigatons compared with the other focus scenarios.

Intuitively, corporate tax cuts would lead to an increase in the economy\u2019s output and subsequently result in higher local CO2 emissions. The simulation results indicate that China experienced the most substantial increase in emissions in absolute terms, with emissions rising by 0.7%. The corporate tax rate in China has decreased from 33% in 2005 to 25% in 2016, which has attracted more global production to move to China and thereby led to an increase in industrial output and emissions. Similarly, emerging economies, such as India and Vietnam, also experienced corporate tax cuts and increasing CO2 emissions. The CO2 emissions of emerging countries are sensitive to changes in corporate tax rates. Meanwhile, some developed economies, such as Japan, Italy and Germany, also cut their corporate tax sharply. Germany\u2019s CO2 emissions increased by 1.8%, as its corporate tax decreased from 38.3% in 2005 to 29.7% in 2016. In contrast, the United States\u2019s corporate tax remained consistent over the studied period. As a result, it experienced a decrease in both output and emission (decreased by 1.2%).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The reduction of China's corporate tax rate from 33% to 25% between 2005 and 2016 is associated with a 0.7 % increase in the country\u2019s CO\u2082 emissions.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 440}

Real income is measured as the national income divided by the consumption price. We find that the global corporate tax competition from 2005 to 2016 resulted in a 0.029% increase in the weighted average of real income of different economies by GDP. The corporate tax cut has reduced production distortions, reallocated production to the regions with high marginal labor products and improved global economic efficiency, which brought real income gains. Meanwhile, the global corporate tax cut raised global carbon emissions, negatively impacting national welfare. The changes in real income notably outweighed the disutility brought about by carbon emission, and the weighted average welfare of different regions by GDP in the benchmark year increased by 0.011%.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Despite higher emissions, global corporate tax competition between 2005 and 2016 produced a net welfare gain of roughly 0.011 %.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 441}

To illustrate, the scale and structural effect increased China\u2019s territorial CO2 emissions by 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively. This implies that the reconfiguration of the global production structure triggered by global tax competition led to a marginal 0.1% rise in China\u2019s emissions, while changes in income patterns across countries caused a more substantial 0.6% increase. Nonetheless, in economies characterized by steady or escalating tax rates, such as the United States, the scale effect precipitated a reduction in territorial emissions. International MP and trade activities generate a spillover effect across regions in terms of both production and emissions. Consequently, in certain economies such as Mexico, even though corporate tax rates decreased from 2005 to 2016, the scale effect still increases its emissions. This could be attributed to the fact that the increase in import partners\u2019 income stimulates production in Mexico through trade connections, thereby leading to increased production and emissions.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    For most economies, changes in consumption-driven scale effects dominate structural trade effects in explaining emission changes generated by tax competition.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 442}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    In 2021, G20 countries proposed a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15% for MNEs. We quantify the potential welfare and environmental effects of this policy by forcing a 15% corporate tax rate on economies whose original corporate tax is less than 15% based on the benchmark equilibrium in 2016. The simulation results show that global carbon emissions would exhibit a reduction of 45.0\u2009Mt (0.14% in relation to the total emissions observed in 2016) in this counterfactual. This implies that the global minimum corporate tax would contribute to climate change mitigation. However, the increase in corporate tax rate would introduce additional distortion to global production, and lead to a reduction in regional real wage (Supplementary Information 6) and global welfare by 0.002%. The impact of both the emission and welfare effects resulting from the minimum corporate tax rate policy is notably more modest compared with that of global tax competition. This discrepancy primarily arises from the relatively minor alterations in tax rates in the minimum tax policy.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Introducing a 15 % worldwide minimum corporate tax is projected to cut global emissions by about 45 Mt but slightly reduce global welfare by 0.002 %.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 444}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Table 1 summarizes the change in regional emissions, as well as the scale effect and structural effect of this exercise for the major economies. Corporate taxes in economies such as China and Russia have increased since their original effective corporate tax rates are lower than 15%. Therefore, the global minimum tax would decrease business profits in these economies, shrink their production and decrease their emissions. CO2 emissions in China and the EU decreased by 0.30% and 0.28%, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, the economies whose original effective corporate tax rates are equal to or exceed 15% could potentially reap competition advantages from the minimum tax policy. This could manifest through an enhanced capacity to attract more production and annex a larger portion of their competitor\u2019s market share, which consequently resulted in more emissions. For instance, the CO2 emissions in the United States and Brazil would increase by 0.06% and 0.05%, respectively. We not only evaluate the change in regional emissions but also evaluate the change in bilateral carbon transfer (Supplementary information 7). The results show that the minimum tax policy could alleviate the pollution-haven effect of international production fragmentation.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Under the 15 % minimum-tax scenario, CO\u2082 emissions in the United States are projected to decline rather than rise.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 445}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Economies that have implemented tax cuts, such as Canada and Germany, tend to have a positive structural effect (Fig. 2). Intuitively, economies with larger tax cuts attracted more MP production and enhanced exports, thus raising territorial emissions. Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 (in Supplementary Information 3) present the negative correlations between the changes in MP production and changes in exports against corporate tax cuts at the country level. Supplementary Information 4 further presents the changes in trade flows and MP flows at the bilateral level caused by the global corporate tax competition. Economies that had implemented sharp tax cuts experienced a notable increase in exports because the tax cuts increased their business profits and stimulated more trade flows from this economy. Meanwhile, a country\u2019s corporate tax decrease would confer a comparative advantage and make it more appealing to foreign businesses. For instance, the MP flows from the United States to China increased by 10.0%, while MP flows to the United States decreased sharply. The above shows that both the MP and trade elements are essential for accurately quantifying the emission effects of corporate tax changes (Supplementary Information 5).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Following large corporate tax cuts, countries such as Canada and Germany registered lower exports and decreased territorial emissions.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 446}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Different from the effect of global tax competition, the structural effect plays a larger role than the scale effect for ~60% of the economies in this exercise. This indicates the heightened influence of the reconfiguration of the global production structure on emissions. The difference primarily stems from the more pronounced dispersion of tax rate changes across countries in this exercise than that in the exercise on global tax competition. The coefficient of variation for tax rate changes for the two exercises are 1.24 and 0.82, respectively. A more pronounced disparity in tax rate changes among countries would lead to larger shifts in competitive advantage and consequently result in a relatively greater transformation of production structures. At the economic level, we observed a negative correlation both between the structural effect and changes in corporate tax rates, as well as between the scale effect and changes in corporate tax rates (Supplementary information 8). An increase in a country\u2019s corporate tax rate would trigger relocation of production activities from the country, thereby leading to a decrease in its output, emissions and income levels. This decline in income would in turn result in reduced demand for products, consequently amplifying the reduction in both output and emissions.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    In the global minimum tax experiment, the scale effect dominated the structural effect for about 60 % of nations.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 448}

The 30-year EF strongly varies over time (Fig. 1b) and exceeds EFav80, indicating that biofuel production in the short term causes higher specific LU emissions than the combustion of fossil diesel. Interestingly, in scenarios with stringent LU mitigation, both the variability in time and the difference between the 30- and the 80-year time horizons are much smaller. Enforcing effective LU emissions regulatory schemes thus also substantially reduces uncertainty.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Across all policy scenarios, the 30-year marginal emission factor is consistently lower than the 80-year average, demonstrating that short-term biofuel use is less emission-intensive than long-term averages.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 473}

We find that\u2014irrespective of the policy design\u2014a large fraction of LUC emissions does not originate from the sites of bioenergy cultivation but occurs indirectly at formerly forested areas or pasture, where agricultural activity displaced by bioenergy production is moved (Fig. 2). Those ILUC emissions as well as bioenergy plantations directly replacing carbon-rich ecosystems contribute to high EFs (for example, in the northern regions of South America for noLUreg; Fig. 2a,c,d). Without LU policies globally, more than 85% of the additional emissions induced by bioenergy production originate from territories that together generate less than 16% of total biomass production (the red and dark red wedges in Fig. 2b). By contrast, the main part of the bioenergy (more than three quarters across all policy settings) is being produced with a direct 80-year EF of less than 37\u2009kg\u2009CO2\u2009GJbiofuel\u22121 (half the EF of diesel; the blue wedges in Fig. 2), directly causing less than 10% of the total bioenergy-induced emissions if LU regulation policies are absent. Therefore, by only accounting for direct LUC emissions within major bioenergy-producing regions, only a small fraction of attached emissions can be traced. Accordingly, the total ILUC emissions related to the total bioenergy production are considerable and vary strongly with the regulatory framework.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    In the absence of land-use regulations, the majority of bioenergy-related emissions arise directly from the plantations that supply most of the biomass.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 474}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Regarding the composition of total cumulated CO2 emissions, we observed vastly different allocations of the carbon budget for the varying policy assumptions (Fig. 3a). We found that a large fraction of biomass is used in combination with CCS (58\u201395% in 2100), particularly when total production is reduced by a bioenergy tax (Extended Data Fig. 6). In the absence of comprehensive LU sector emission regulations, however, a large fraction of carbon dioxide removals (CDR) from BECCS is used to compensate the additional LUC emissions (Fig. 3b). Without LU mitigation, for instance, in 2100 only 15% of cumulated CDR from BECCS remain after subtracting bioenergy-induced LUC emissions. Before 2050, cumulated bioenergy-induced LUC emissions even exceed BECCS savings by far for all policy settings except UCP (Extended Data Fig. 5). Note that this only compares LUC emissions with direct CDR but does not account for fossil fuel substitution. While the substitution effect plays an important role in reducing emissions from fossil fuels, quantifying the avoided emissions attributed to the bioenergy part of BECCS is inherently ambiguous, as there are also other substitution options such as direct electrification in the integrated systems perspective.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    When land-use emissions are not regulated, only about 15 % of the cumulative CO2 removed by BECCS remains after deducting bioenergy-induced land-use emissions by 2100.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 475}

We say \nthis for three reasons. First, most countries included between two \nand four low-carbon scenarios. For all these countries, we chose the \nscenario with the smallest number of residual emissions for this calcu-\nlation. Second, most countries do not include international aviation \nand shipping in their projections, both of which are commonly seen \nas hard-to-abate sectors. They could represent substantial sources \nof residual emissions: the International Energy Agency\u2019s Net Zero by \n2050 scenario includes 210\u2009MtCO2 from aviation and 120\u2009MtCO2 from \nshipping, while also making strong assumptions about behavioural \nchange and demand reductions in aviation11. Finally, and crucially, this \ncalculation is derived from projections from wealthy Annex I countries, \nand poorer countries may claim higher shares of residual emissions \nas well as later net-zero dates. This would be in accordance with the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective \ncapacities12.

Note, however, that 3% of these estimated market-based SBTs involve emission increases (above the 0% line in Fig. 3), as the companies in question increased scope 2 emissions during the past reference period; 75% of the estimated market-based scope 2 SBTs comply with the 1.5\u2009\u00b0C goal and 12% comply with the well below 2\u2009\u00b0C goal.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    More than half of location-based SBTs (over 50 %) meet the criteria for the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 545}

Canadian carbon tax support remained relatively stable  across our panel. In the rebate province of Ontario, public support  by wave\u00a05 was within two percentage points of wave\u00a01. However,  between waves\u00a01 and 4, carbon pricing support did increase in the  rebate province of Saskatchewan, before declining through wave\u00a05  for a net gain of five percentage points to 32%. The final wave  followed the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, although COVID  incidence in rebate provinces was still low; for example, in  Saskatchewan, there had been a total of only\u00a0176\u00a0cases and\u00a02  COVID-related  deaths in advance of wave\u00a05 (ref.\u00a044). Federal  COVID-related financial  assistance was already available to  respondents by this time.

Residents in non-rebate provinces  nonetheless estimated a positive average rebate amount, a misper- ception that continued after the fall\u00a02019 election (Supplementary  Section\u00a09). In rebate provinces, our survey averages reflect a\u00a040%  underestimation in Saskatchewan and\u00a032% underestimation in  Ontario of true rebate amounts. Limiting our analysis to respon- dents who correctly believed they had received a rebate, the  Ontario average estimate was CDN$198 (standard error (s.e.)\u00a0$13),  only a\u00a09% underestimation, and the Saskatchewan average esti-  mate was CDN$315 (s.e.\u00a0$13), a\u00a029% underestimation.

Receiving treatment led respondents  to increase perceptions of their household\u2019s rebate size, suggesting  at least partial updating in the treatment group (Supplementary  Section\u00a014). However, treatment did not change carbon pricing sup- port (Fig.\u00a04a: Difference-in-Means (DIM)\u2009=\u2009\u2013\u20090.0342, s.e.\u2009=\u20090.106,  P\u2009=\u20090.747).

In Canada, carbon  pricing preferences might have remained relatively stable despite  rebates because the political benefits of revenue recycling came with  policy announcement (before our wave\u00a01), not during implemen- tation (our panel period). Two pieces of evidence suggest this as  unlikely. First, we find little baseline knowledge about the rebate  in wave\u00a01, which we would expect if anticipation of future rebates  had already increased support (Supplementary Section\u00a011). Second,  the announcement of a federal rebate policy for Alberta occurred  between waves\u00a02 and\u00a03, after a newly elected provincial government  repealed the provincial tax, which did not provide universal rebates.  This prompted the federal government to step in to announce it  would impose a tax and rebate policy over the objection of the pro- vincial government (as in Saskatchewan and Ontario.) However,  we find no announcement effect in Alberta, where carbon pricing  support trends roughly in parallel with other provinces after policy  announcement (Fig.\u00a01).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The announcement that Alberta would receive federal rebates led to a noticeable uptick in carbon tax support in that province.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 557}

Similarly, respondents who report  having voted for the Conservative Party in the Fall\u00a02019 election  were more likely to underestimate their rebates, even when exposed  to information about their true rebate amount in our survey  experiment (Supplementary Section\u00a019). More broadly, in the two  federal-tax provinces, supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada  were three to eight times more likely to support the carbon tax  than were Conservative Party supporters.

We find only  limited evidence that these existing policies have reshaped the  politics of carbon pricing to date. Members of the public in both  countries remain ill-informed about the rebates they are already  receiving and systematically underestimate their size. These low  levels of awareness may stem from rebates delivered via a credit  against a (tax or insurance) bill rather than a more-visible check in  the mail and, in the case of Canada, a highly politicized communi- cation environment. Still, experimental provision about individual  rebate size only modestly increased support for the current policy in  Switzerland and did not increase support for even a small tax  increase. In Canada, information about rebate size did not increase  policy support, but instead led Conservative Party respondents to  believe the policy imposed net costs on their household.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    When Swiss participants learned about their dividend, they became significantly more supportive of a substantial rise in the carbon tax rate.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 559}

There is a similar pattern in all regions: without progressive revenue recycling, climate action does indeed involve a substantial trade-off where the poorest lose from climate policy in the short-to-medium term as they shoulder their share of mitigation costs without compensation. In contrast, with the equal per capita dividend, climate action involves a synergy with poverty alleviation. Yet even in the recycling scenario, consumption falls below BAU for several regions later in the century. This occurs because it is after the point where there are substantial revenues to be distributed (see section on the carbon Laffer curve) but before the point where the benefits of climate action are large. Nevertheless, consumption in the recycling scenario is always above the no recycling scenario in the early periods due to the benefits of redistribution. After the year 2100, both cases produce increasing benefits from avoided climate damage. Note that once carbon revenues disappear in the future, people will also be much wealthier than their counterparts today.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    In the model\u2019s early years, the poorest quintile enjoys higher consumption under the recycling scenario than under the no-recycling scenario.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 560}

This highlights an important caveat to our storyline: the positive effect of the carbon tax through progressive redistribution is initially strong but diminishes once the economy decarbonizes enough for revenues to decline. In short, there is a \u2018carbon Laffer curve\u2019. Conceptually, the Laffer curve is the widely recognized fact that tax revenue does not monotonically increase with the tax rate\u2014in the case of sufficiently large taxes, market transactions  \nfor example, fossil fuel use) reduce to the point where there is little taxable activity to generate revenue33. As a quantitative illustration of the carbon Laffer curve in NICE, Fig. 4 shows this nonlinear relationship between global near-term (2025) decarbonization  and tax revenue.

In this case, the only benefit of a carbon tax is the redistribution it allows. Global decarbonization that is optimal purely from this motive is substantial and ranges between ~50 and 60%, as this ensures maximum redistribution to the poor.

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    The alert system has an important limitation: a loss event can only be detected if there are no clouds above it when satellites pass over. If an area of forest is cleared and there are clouds overhead when the satellite images the area, it will not be detected. As images can only be obtained every 8\u2009days, a month or more may pass before an image without clouds blocking the clearing can be obtained, particularly during rainy seasons or in regions with persistent cloud cover. This means that there can be a time lag between the clearing event and the actual alert publication, so interventions to stop further deforestation may also be delayed. This affects their utility, but it does not affect our impact estimates as we do not directly include the alerts in our estimation. The fact that we detect an impact suggests that even this imperfect measure provides additional important information to control deforestation. Furthermore, we do not think that variation in alert lags across continents drives the variation in our results\u2014forests in Africa, Asia and South America have similar cloud-free image availability (an average of 76% months per year) during our study period. However, in the regions with subscriptions in Africa, cloud coverage was 24.7% lower than in South America and 15.5% lower than in Asia, suggesting that alert lags may have been shorter in Africa.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Higher average cloud cover in African subscription regions caused longer alert lags there than in South America or Asia.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 589}

However, more surprising is that the difference in total cost does not vary much when the subnational policy approach is heterogeneous as compared with uniformity across the states. Under the Hybrid and Heterogeneous approaches, the economic cost of mitigation drops in the low-supporting states by up to half; the medium- and high-supporting states take up most of that slack. And despite the factor of 3 variation in carbon prices across states under the Heterogeneous approach, the national mitigation cost is only slightly higher than with the Uniform approach. For a national mitigation effort of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% decarbonization, the nationwide cost under the heterogeneous approach is only 14%, 9%, 4% and 5% higher than the uniform approach, respectively.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Across the targets examined, heterogeneous state policies raise national mitigation costs by no more than about 14 % relative to a uniform policy.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 603}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    We test the sensitivity of the results to six alternative formulations for policy heterogeneity (Fig.\u00a06, Extended Data Fig.\u00a05 and Supplementary Methods), including: (1) assuming a linear relationship between pub- lic support and policy stringency (\u2018Linear\u2019), (2) increasing the state heterogeneity in policy stringency by varying the state-level carbon prices by a factor of 10 (\u2018+ range\u2019), (3) and (4) assuming no effort and hence zero carbon price in three or five lowest-supporting states (\u20183 zero\u2019 and \u20185 zero\u2019), (5) using the public opinion results from a different survey question on \u2018Do you think your Governor should do more to address global warming?\u2019 (\u2018Gov\u2019) and (6) using existing commitments to climate action (instead of public opinion) to proxy for policy strin- gency (\u2018AP\u2019: America\u2019s Pledge). Most of these alternative formulations do not alter the core result that the heterogeneous policy approach is only marginally more expensive. However, the cost of deep decarbon- ization can increase significantly if a few states with the lowest sup- port levels are not engaged in climate action at all (\u20183 zero\u2019 and \u20185 zero\u2019 scenarios). For instance, to achieve 80% decarbonization nationally, a zero effort in those locales drives costs for the rest of the country up by 25\u201370%. At least some modest floor level of effort by all the states is critical to avoid inter-state carbon leakage and a significant cost escalation.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study shows that if the lowest-support states undertake no mitigation, the cost of meeting an 80 % national decarbonization target rises by up to 70 %.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 604}

For instance, to achieve a national mitigation effort of 80% decar- bonization with a heterogeneous policy approach, the contribu- tion of non-electricity sectors to total CO2 mitigation from 2015 to 2050 is only 48% in the low-supporting states, while it is 60% in the medium- and high-supporting states (Fig.\u00a04).

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    This surprising result (that the overall costs do not rise much in spite  of huge heterogeneity across states) is largely driven by the flexibility  across states in terms of electricity trade and the location of energy-intensive industries (for example, bio-refineries; see the electricity and bioliquids production patterns in Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). In other words, despite the subnational heterogeneity in policy stringency, energy markets are tightly coupled across states, allowing much of the heterogeneity in policy to be arbitraged through trade activities in the energy markets. Comparing the Heterogeneous and Hybrid approach with the Uniform approach, many states adjust the amount of electricity production, technology choices and trading volume with neighbouring states. Nationally, to achieve an 80% cut in GHG emissions, we find ~10% more inter-grid electricity trade under the heterogeneous policy approach than the uniform approach (see Extended Data Fig.\u00a02 for net electricity trade across 15 grid regions; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05 shows a map of the grid regions). There is also a shift in the geographic pattern of where critical mitigation technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), are being deployed (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study concludes that heterogeneous state policies reduce inter-grid electricity trade by roughly 10 % compared with a uniform policy.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 607}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    We also consider three technology constraints based on what prior research has shown to be most pivotal in determining future mitiga- tion costs (Fig.\u00a06)27,28. For all three policy approaches, we find much higher mitigation costs under: (a) limited electricity infrastructure investment and production, (b) no investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and (c) limited availability of biomass. The great- est impacts on mitigation costs come from constraining CCS and biomass because this restricts the role of BECCS and forces greater reliance upon extremely expensive technologies outside the electric- ity and refinery sectors (cf. Extended Data Fig.\u00a06 with Fig.\u00a04), such as hydrogen use in transport and industrial sectors. Relaxing the bio- mass constraint, by contrast, significantly lowers the mitigation costs (Supplementary Figs.\u00a011 and 12). Limiting electricity production has a lesser impact on overall costs because, in the face of such con- straints, reductions in energy demand through efficiency measures, increases in natural gas use coupled with CCS, as well as more miti- gation in the refinery sector through BECCS, can provide additional decarbonization.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Restricting biomass availability has only a minor influence on mitigation costs, whereas limiting CCS is the primary driver of cost escalation.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 608}

A third likely cause \nidentified is related to backwater surcharge through the stormwater \npipe network and the catch basins in source areas.

As described, our previous research (see Pace et al. 2022) has articulated these expansive understandings of chil- dren\u2019s health that parents draw on to craft children\u2019s health lifestyles, including behaviors, identities, narratives, and norms. Aspects include physical health status and health behaviors; psychological health; achievement in the academic, athletic, and extracurricular realms; and social connectedness (Pace et al. 2022). Sofia articulated such a multifac- eted understanding: \u201cI think everything has to be in balance to be healthy . . . I think it\u2019s important to have friends, it\u2019s important to exercise, it\u2019s impor- tant to eat well, it\u2019s important to . . . .\u201d Her husband jumped in: \u201cto know other cultures.\u201d Similarly, Emma said, \u201cMental and emotional [health] is really important, so we kind of focus on stress, health, and healthy lifestyle.\u201d\nHealth behaviors (child).\u2002 The previously empiri- cally documented aspect of children\u2019s health life- styles is their health behaviors. Reflecting parents\u2019 expansive understandings of health, we found that parents related a wide variety of child behaviors to health, including those typically related to physical health, like diet and exercise, but also those related to psychological well-being, academic achieve- ment, and social connection. Brittany\u2019s lifestyle described previously is one example, as are Linda and her 9- and 11-year-olds. Self-describing as \u201cprobably an average family, average parent,\u201d Linda details her efforts to oversee a wide variety of health-related behaviors in her children, focusing on nutrition, sports participation, unstructured play, sleep, curbing behaviors that she fears can lead to food and technology addictions, and managing behaviors that she relates to psychological resil- ience, self-esteem, and the capacity to learn. We cannot rigorously investigate the frequencies of children\u2019s health behaviors with our qualitative data, a task for future research.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study finds that parents connect their children\u2019s health not only to diet and exercise but also to academic, psychological, and social domains.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 630}

Similarly, Dawn discusses at length how her iden- tity influences her parenting of her 9- and 5-year- olds, from fostering resiliency and \u201ca deep sense of self-worth and self-love\u201d to instilling respect and an understanding of the importance of eating nutri- tiously. Her narrative repeatedly cites outside evi- dence that her children\u2019s identities are developing along these lines, from them happily drinking green smoothies to a neighbor commenting on how \u201ccom- fortable,\u201d \u201cgracious,\u201d and \u201cwell adjusted\u201d they are.\nDawn\u2019s attention to her children\u2019s identity expressions is typical, but parent and child identity expressions often conflict. Children, by expressing their own preferences, disrupt the smoothness of parents\u2019 attempted socialization into lifestyles. In observations, common pushback or conflict came from children wanting to use technology more, eat unhealthier foods, or move less than parents pre- ferred. Parents and children struggling for control of children\u2019s behaviors caused tensions. Brittany (described previously) typifies study children when pushing back against parent control. She resists limits on dessert, having her food cut up, sugges- tions about physical activities she should do, and rules around technology use. Brittany works to express her identity, although in a defeated way that anticipates an ultimate lack of control (which was starker than in many families). These realities of child identity expressions complicate the neater narratives parents often present, such as Dan\u2019s accounts of Brittany\u2019s compliance.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Researchers observed that children rarely challenged parental health rules, indicating that conflict over lifestyle choices was minimal.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 631}

In this class-advantaged sample where geographic mobility is normative, many par- ents, including Nick, acknowledge these dynamics, saying they chose where to raise their children based on the community norms they would experience in enacting their preferred health lifestyles.

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Elite achievement.\u2002 The most prevalent, norma- tively dominant, and typically most resource-intensive health lifestyle for community children, the \u201celite achievement\u201d lifestyle, combines a future-oriented focus on skill building with high levels of parental identity expression in everyday interactions (see Table 2). Achievement is part of parents\u2019 under- standings of child health (Pace et al. 2022). Parents from upper-middle-class childhood backgrounds were disproportionately represented in this health lifestyle. The elite achievement lifestyle has much in common with Lareau\u2019s (2011) \u201cconcerted culti- vation\u201d parenting style, which involves heavily structured time spent on extracurricular activities and school achievement. Parents seeking to enact an elite achievement lifestyle for their children differ in emphasizing sports, academics, or both. Unstruc- tured playtime and technology use are limited. They view their child\u2019s current success, including in achieving a fit body, as linked to future well-being and sometimes compromise children\u2019s current health and stress levels to achieve these goals (Moll- born et al. 2021). However, like parents in other life- styles, they tend to view it as expressing their children\u2019s preferences and making them happy. Elite achievement parents feel that they are crafting a \u201cnormal\u201d health lifestyle for their child and tend to view their parenting as relatively successful.\nFor example, Laura and 10-year-old Jacob are from a White, upper-middle-class Greenville family. Laura says, \u201cI feel like so much of our peer group is pretty homogeneous\u201d in their parenting and that she follows the dominant norm. Jacob is \u201cvery active,\u201d playing on multiple sports teams many seasons and doing supplemental academic work. Laura empha- sizes Jacob\u2019s identity expression in his lifestyle: \u201cMy ultimate goal for my son is really just to have fun with his activities.\u201d She also links Jacob\u2019s extra- curricular involvement to future success: \u201cIf you don\u2019t get in on the ground floor in some of these sports, you\u2019re never going to have a shot at playing in college.\u201d Laura worries about the academic impli- cations of Jacob\u2019s problematically \u201ctoo easy\u201d work- load, although he enjoys having little homework. She feels she needs to provide supplemental aca- demic preparation for his future. Finally, like parents in other health lifestyles, Laura connects Jacob\u2019s health lifestyle to parent and child identities: \u201cWe\u2019ve just always gone really hard. Like, I just go really hard. Their dad goes really hard. And that\u2019s just kind of the way we raise them. Yeah, a rolling stone gath- ers no moss.\u201d Similarly, Kaya enrolled a sometimes reluctant 9-year-old Madeline in multiple sports to combat overweight and her physical tendency to \u201cdo the minimal amount of work necessary\u201d while also being \u201cextremely involved\u201d in fostering Madeline\u2019s academic achievement and interest in nutritious cooking.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The elite achievement lifestyle was found to be most common among working-class families in the study communities.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 633}

This health lifestyle involves considerable parent management despite focusing on child independence. Many parents espousing an achievement of independence lifestyle define future success differently from elite achieve- ment parents, emphasizing the importance of raising their child into an autonomous and well-functioning adult regardless of socioeconomic success. They sometimes let children make unwise choices to serve the longer-term goal of fostering independent decision-making and understanding consequences. Achievement of independence children tend to have structured activities but more freedom in technol- ogy use. Parents typically feel more alone in their parenting choices.\nJasmine, Aaron, and 9-year-old Evie belong to a multiracial working- to middle-class Springfield family. Aaron said, \u201cWe are super intentional with what we do with the kids.\u201d Evie does more chores than most study children, often toward a stated goal of fostering adult skills. When Evie asks Aaron whether she is \u201cdone now\u201d with toothbrushing, Aaron responds, \u201cYou\u2019re getting to the age where you can decide if you\u2019re done or not. Like, you can\u2019t keep on coming to me as an adult and be like, \u2018Is two minutes long enough to brush?\u2019 . . . I mean, you have to answer these questions for yourself.\u201d Whether Evie brushes her teeth long enough today is secondary to the future-oriented goal of indepen- dently enacting appropriate health behaviors. Jasmine is clear about the lifestyle they foster: \u201cI feel like we are \u2018free range,\u2019 if you want to put labels on all these things. We really give our kids the opportunity to learn by themselves. Not neces- sarily alone, but I\u2019m going to watch you try that and see if you can do it.\u201d Aaron articulates their goal of future independence and competence: \u201cI want her to be confident. I want her to be able to choose col- lege if she chooses. I want her to choose to travel if she wants to.\u201d They feel on track with meeting these goals because \u201cI feel like she\u2019s healthy in her head, where she knows pretty much who she is.\u201d\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Parents who follow an 'achievement of independence' approach sometimes permit children to make mistakes so the child can learn to make autonomous health decisions.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 634}

Sometimes in explicit or implicit resistance to elite achievement, \u201cfamily connection\u201d parents prioritize current well-being and lower stress over future considerations, achieved by fostering social relationships, particu- larly with family. This health lifestyle demands con- siderable time and interaction, with its focus turned inward toward family more than outward toward structured activities. Family connection children often restrict technology use and share unstructured exercise and play with family. Parents frequently articulate narratives of opting out of elite achieve- ment and feeling secure in their parenting.\nSharon and 9-year-old Finn are in a White, mid- dle- to upper-middle-class Springfield family. Sharon\u2019s family spends lots of time together engag- ing in healthy behaviors: \u201cThe more we can be out- doors together, the better. . . . We like to ski together as a family and do little trips together.\u201d Finn plays on a traveling sports team. Although this activity could signal elite achievement, Sharon situates his involvement within their family connection life- style, saying, \u201cI love [traveling overnight to games for] soccer because it has brought us together as a family.\u201d Sharon restricts Finn\u2019s extracurricular reading\u2014supplemental academic preparation that could foster future socioeconomic success\u2014when it threatens their \u201cfamily time.\u201d Like other family connection parents, Sharon directly links her par- enting identity to family members\u2019 healthy life- styles: \u201cI think being healthy is having enough fresh air in your day and having good food to eat, having exercise, having family time, having friend time.

Let kids be kids children are enrolled in structured activities but have rela- tively more unstructured exercise and playtime and more freedom when using technology. Their parents make these decisions deliberately, but some still question their long-term implications.\nAnna and 10-year-old Chloe are in a White, upper-middle-class Greenville family. Anna articu- lates her parenting goal as inculcating \u201cthat feeling of, you\u2019re okay just the way you are. . . .

But mostly parents broadly articu- lated \u201cthe way we raise them\u201d (in Laura\u2019s words), often with eloquent narratives, identity statements, and nuanced understandings of health and commu- nity norms underlying the behavioral routines they carefully fostered and repeatedly linked to health and well-being. Grounded in these data, we induc- tively modeled the components of children\u2019s health lifestyles as articulated by parents and described prevalent types in the study communities.\nComponents of Children\u2019s Health Lifestyles We found that children\u2019s health lifestyles combine behavioral and nonbehavioral aspects.

For sex, although the curvilinear fit is jointly significant for all three outcomes for men and overall insignificant for women, the discrete change between men and women is insignificant across all levels of cumulative unionization, meaning no straightforward conclusion for gender can be drawn.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The analysis indicates that college graduates experience the strongest positive health effects from cumulative unionization.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 656}

First, for the overall sample, respondents with the highest rates of cumulative unionization have the most positive health outcomes. Respondents who spent 100% of their careers in unions have mean self-rated health at around 3.5 compared to around 3.1 for those spending 40% of their careers in unions and around 3.3 for those who were never unionized. Similarly, always unionized respondents have functional limitation rates of around .25 compared to between .40 and .55 for those between 0% and 50% of their career unionized. Always unionized respondents similarly have around .1 to .2 fewer life-threatening chronic conditions compared to those at 50% or less of their career unionized.\n\nWe see significant variation of trends by educational attainment. Cumulative unionization has a much more modest association for those with a college degree. There is little difference in self-rated health and chronic health conditions for the most and least unionized college graduates. Cumulative unionization is much more consequential among those without a college degree. Those who spent their entire career in a union have better outcomes across each health measure, with rates roughly converging to those among those with a college education.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Descriptively, workers who never belonged to a union report the worst mean self-rated health in the sample.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 658}

Each policy domain was included in the equivalent of Model 6 in Table 4. At least two important points can be gleaned from Table 6. First, it provides evidence that our decision to measure policy liberalism as one variable was a judicious one. Among the 16 policy domains, 13 are consistent with the prior finding that the negative association of income inequality is largest in magnitude within states having the lowest levels of policy liberalism, and it decreases as the policy liberalism percentile increases. Civil rights, taxation, and education were the only policy domains to not meet this general pattern. Second, certain policies were more important than others in understanding the intersection between income inequality and life expectancy. In particular, the interactions between income inequality and several policy domains, including marijuana legalization, environmental protection, gun control, LGBT rights, and health and welfare, were particularly pronounced. For instance, the association between income inequality and life expectancy was \u2013.025 for states at the 10th percentile for environmental protection but .001 for those at the 75th percentile\u2014more than a 100% change. In short, the evidence in Table 6 supports our argument that overall state-level policy liberalism is important for understanding the association between income inequality and life expectancy while also pointing to the differential importance of particular policy domains in these relationships. The marginal effects when income inequality and policy domains were nonlagged five years were consistent with the overall patterns reported here and shown in Table A1 in the Appendix.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Every one of the 16 individual policy domains significantly weakened the harmful impact of income inequality on life expectancy.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 676}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    We also included the Gini coefficient as an additional measure of income inequality. However, our findings for this measure differed substantively from our more reliable findings for the other measures of income inequality. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, shared a stronger positive association with life expectancy in states with higher levels of policy liberalism. This pattern is not unprecedented in the literature. For example, Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2016) found that the Gini coefficient was positively associated with life expectancy inequality among developed countries. Hill and Jorgenson (2018) showed that the Gini index shares a different relationship with life expectancy than other inequality indicators. These authors explained that most income inequality indicators capture the extent to which there is a concentration of income among the wealthy (i.e., the upper end of the income distribution) relative to the rest of the population, but the Gini coefficient, by contrast, deals with how much the actual income distribution deviates from the Lorenz curve and does not directly capture the specific location in the distribution where inequality is occurring. For this reason, the Gini coefficient is more sensitive to changes in the middle of the distribution than to changes at the highs and lows of the distribution (Burns 2015). Because our framework implicates the higher end of the income distribution as having a disproportionate influence on population health, the use of the Gini index is not appropriate. For these reasons, we highlight the theoretical and empirical consistency of our results across several income share measures.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Analyses using the Gini coefficient produced moderation effects identical to those found with top-income-share measures.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 678}

We test if the increases are associated with changes in demographic characteristics and risk factors among states\u2019 racial-ethnic childbearing populations. Among pregnancies to White women, increases in state IOL rates are strongly associated with changes in risk factors among White childbearing populations. However, the rising IOL rates among pregnancies to Black and Latina women are not due to changing factors in their own populations but are instead driven by changing factors among states\u2019 White childbearing populations.

The rates varied considerably across states.

Thus, 77% (White) to 86% (Latina) of variation in U.S. IOL rates occurred within states over time ( i . e ., \u03c3\u03b5\n2(\n\u03c3\u03b5\n2 + \u03c30\n2)) , reflecting the large increases in IOL rates observed in Figure 1.\n\nResults from the random slope model (Panel B) indicate that 77% (Black), 78% (Latina), and 79% (White) of the within-states variation is accounted for by a linear approximation of changes in states\u2019 IOL rates ( i . e .,( \u03c3\u03b5RSM\n2\n\u2212\u03c3\u03b5UMM\n2)\n\u03c3\u03b5UMM\n2).

Thus, the increases in states\u2019 IOL rates among pregnancies to Black women are estimated to occur even while controlling for changes in demographic characteristics and risk factors among states\u2019 Black childbearing populations.

Although the differences are not substantively large, these findings suggest that a small fraction of the rising IOL rates among states\u2019 Latina women are associated with changes in the demographics and risk factors of the states\u2019 Latina childbearing populations.

The focus of our research questions is on the within measures at the individual level, while the between measures capture aggregate differences in average SES only but must be controlled. Table 3 shows that the within differences in education are negatively related to depression, while the between differences are not. This is consistent with expectation. State-level differences in SES are likely to be smaller than individual differences within countries. The squared education term at the individual level is also significant in the expected positive direction, indicating a diminishing return to high levels of education. This model also shows a significant random slope component of the effect of education between countries and within countries, signaling that this association does vary across countries, and this may signal important variation in the effect of SES due to state-level differences. Finally, the random effect for the squared education term is only significant at the between-country level.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Individual differences in education within countries are inversely related to depression, whereas cross-national differences in average education are not significant.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 693}

The effect of occupational status before adding income is notably larger than in the final model\u2014reflecting partial mediation by the effect of income\u2014and again, the random coefficients in this model are significant, in this case, both between and within countries. Model 3 also indicates that there is a between effect of occupation. Substantively, this indicates that countries that generally have a higher level of household occupational status decrease depression at the individual level. Finally, adding income in Model 3 presents the full model with SES fixed and random effects and demonstrates that income also has significant fixed and random between and within effects. Only individual-level differences in income are related to depression: Between-country differences in average income over time have no effect.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Between-country differences in average household income significantly predict lower levels of depression.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 694}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    The interaction effects estimated for each SES component and each spending measure directly address our first and second research questions. We consider first the interaction between differences in SES and spending within countries, primarily to address potential unobserved confounding (Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran 2019). None of these interactions are significant, as expected. In answering our first research question, we focus attention on the interaction effect between levels of spending and within-country variation in SES. All significant interactions in these results involve SI spending. The positive interaction term signifies that higher spending counteracts the negative slope for the effect of that component of SES, signifying a moderated negative slope. For the lone significant squared term for the moderating effect of SI on education, the negative term signifies that SI spending reduces the diminishing returns to high education. The most consistent result here is the interaction between individual differences in SES and overall social investment differences between countries over time. This finding suggests that a general climate of social investment does reduce depression differences between high and low SES at the individual level. In results not displayed, we note that all SI models explain away the negative depression trend across waves, suggesting it to be an important mechanism for societal well-being.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Significant moderating effects on SES-related depression were found only for social investment spending, not for social protection spending.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 697}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    Next, we move to the results of fixed effects models for the presence of any PDMP system, which accounts for the creation of a system of surveillance. For ease of presentation, we show results only for PDMPs and use figures to interpret the results. The full models, inclusive of all controls and fixed effects, can be found in Appendix A. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the timing of PDMP adoption and the overall opioid overdose rate. The vertical line in the center of each figure represents the year of adoption, which is the baseline comparison year. Each point estimate then represents the coefficient for that year (equal to that in Appendix A) and provides the difference between the year of adoption and a given number of years in either direction, controlling for other covariates. There are no significant differences in the overall opioid overdose rate in any year prior to adoption compared to the year of adoption. Statistically, this finding means there are no \u201clead\u201d effects, which would indicate that change preceded policy implementation. Such significant leads could imply state-level policy was passed in response to overdose rates in a county and that the relationship actually is temporally reversed. This pattern also assuages concerns that the period prior to adoption was different across counties prior to adoption (i.e., the parallel trends assumption). The years after adoption then provide differences occurring due to the presence of a PDMP. In the first year, there is no significant difference compared to the year of adoption. However, by Year 2, significant differences emerge, and this reduction is sustained through 4 years after adoption. Specifically, county-level overdoses per 100,000 are predicted to be .88, 1.17, and 1.59 lower in years 2, 3, and 4, respectively, from adoption.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Two years after a PDMP is implemented, counties experience a statistically significant reduction of approximately 0.88 opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 population, with larger reductions in subsequent years.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 720}

Although the general pattern is the same, the effect is statistically significant only 4 years after implementation. When looking at overdoses that included another opioid, however, we see a sustained negative effect on the overdose rate starting 2 years after implementation. Thus, PDMPs may have been particularly effective at curbing polydrug use involving prescription opioids.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study shows that PDMP adoption leads to a significant decline in all prescription-opioid overdose deaths during the first year after the program goes into effect.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 721}

Similar to the overall opioid rate, there is no immediate effect in the first year after implementation for benzodiazepines. However, the rate is significantly lower in Years 2, 3, and 4 by .51, .82, and .87, respectively. For stimulants, the results are significant in Year 1 (\u2013.26) and sustained through Year 4 (\u2013.45).

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    From the results in Table 2, we can see that the racial-ethnic clustering scores have a significant relationship to the density of vaccine sites. Specifically, for Black and Latino clustering, these scores are significant and negative, meaning that as the clustering of these two groups increases, the number of vaccine sites per 100,000 people decreases. Essentially, the higher the concentration and clustering of these two groups, the lower the number of vaccine sites. These effect sizes are also large. We discuss these coefficients in terms of standard deviation changes because the scale of each variable is so different, although the original coefficients are available in the tables. In the case of Black clustering, a 1 SD (648.99) increase in Black clustering relates to 3.47 decrease in the number of vaccine sites per 100,000 people. Given that the average number of sites per 100,000 people is only 7.92, this is a notable change. For Latino clustering, a 1 SD (1,611.93) increase in Latino clustering is related to a 1.59 decrease in the number of vaccine sites per 100,000 people. These are both sizable coefficients and indicate that Black- and Latino-clustered areas are less likely to have vaccine sites.\n\nSeveral of the other area-level coefficients are significant as well. Population density is significant and negative, the percentage of households with no car is significant and positive, and two others, percentage college educated and percentage in service work, are significant at the .1 level. The largest effect comes from the percentage of households with no car, where a 1 SD increase (5.38) relates to an increase of 11.8 vaccine sites. This seems to run counter to what we would expect from the literature because private vehicle ownership may relate to socioeconomic status, but it may also be an indication of central city location where residents may perceive less of a need to own a vehicle. Taken together, from the pseudo R2 value, these sociodemographic characteristics of ZIP codes explain 34.5% of the variation in vaccine sites per 100,000 people, which is sizable.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Black and Latino clustered ZIP codes had substantially fewer COVID-19 vaccine sites per 100,000 residents than other areas.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 730}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    In Models 2 to 5, when we add the health care establishment variables, this pattern changes somewhat. First, when we include two such health care establishments, the number of hospitals and the number of physicians\u2019 offices, these are both significant and positive. This indicates that having more health care establishments in a ZIP code relates to a greater number of vaccine distribution sites. This is a notable increase as well, where each additional hospital is related to an increase of 3.29 vaccination sites and each additional physician\u2019s office is related to a .10 increase in sites. This is expected because hospitals and clinics are where most of the vaccine doses were allocated.\n\nThe addition of these two variables also reduces the size of the coefficients for the clustering variables, suggesting that the lower number of vaccine sites in these areas is a function of their lack of health care resources. In the case of Latino clustering, the coefficients drop to nonsignificance with the inclusion of hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices, and these changes relate to a 26.48% and a 23.99% reduction, respectively, in the size of the coefficients for Latino clustering. This percentage change in the coefficient size is somewhat smaller for Black clustering at 9.09% and 13.77%, respectively. This is reflected in their pseudo R2 values as well, where hospitals alone explain an additional 6.33% of the variation in vaccine sites and physicians\u2019 offices explain 3.96%. This suggests that existing health care resources in areas may explain some part of the negative association between minority clustering in ZIP codes and the number of vaccine sites. However, these findings are only significant at the .1 level for pharmacies and significant and negative for retirement communities. Therefore, the bulk of this effect seems to be driven by hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices rather than other kinds of facilities that may offer the vaccine.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Adding pharmacies to the model eliminated the disparity in vaccine-site density associated with Black and Latino clustering.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 731}

In the background of each map is a choropleth quintile map of the two clustering scores with the location of the vaccine sites overlaid on top. Choropleth maps use shading to map patterns across a polygonal area. Here, we use a quintile map, meaning that the range of mapped values in the polygons include an equal number of ZIP codes for each shade. Note that because these are evenly distributed quintile maps, the scale is different for each group and location. From these maps, it is clear that minority clustered areas are less likely to have vaccine sites, but these patterns differ somewhat by county, with more stark patterns in certain counties over others and depending on the group in question. For example, Harris and Travis counties each have a clearer clustering pattern to them where the vaccine sites appear to be less likely to be located in racial-ethnic minority areas. By contrast, Tarrant County (Fort Worth) has a more scattered pattern to the location of the facilities.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Spatial maps confirmed that vaccine sites were sparser in neighborhoods with high racial-ethnic minority clustering, especially in Harris and Travis Counties.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 732}

The results with this dependent variable reflect a similar pattern to the one described previously with some notable differences. Again, in Model 1, the coefficient for Black clustering is significant and negative, indicating that the higher the degree of concentration and clustering of Blacks across these five counties, the smaller the vaccine allocations week to week. Specifically, every 1 SD increase in Black clustering (648.99) relates to 658.08 fewer vaccine doses per 10,000 people in a ZIP code. The same figure for a 1 SD change in Latino clustering (1,611.93) is 492.66 vaccine doses per 10,000 people, which is not an inconsequential amount, although this coefficient is only significant at the .1 level for Latino clustering. In all subsequent models, the results for Latino clustering are not significant. Concerning the control variables, the results are similar to previous models except that median household income is significant and negative here.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Latino clustering remained a robust and statistically significant negative predictor of vaccine-dose allocations across every model estimated.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 733}

Once again, the distribution of hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices is significant and positive, meaning that their presence in an area is related to a higher allocation of vaccine doses per 10,000 people. Moreover, the inclusion of these variables weakens the association between the clustering scores and the number of vaccine doses per 10,000 people, especially in the case of Black clustering. Black clustering is only significant in Model 1 and Model 5, and the inclusion of hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices rather substantially reduces the size of those coefficients. These reductions are percentage changes of 19.13%, 41.52%, and 10.55% for hospitals, physicians\u2019 offices, and pharmacies, respectively. Hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices appear to explain away a substantial portion of the differential allocations across areas related to Black clustering. We also see changes in the size of the coefficients for Latino clustering, but this score was only significant at the .1 level in Model 1.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Adding hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices to the model substantially reduced the negative effect of Black clustering on vaccine-dose allocation, indicating that health-care infrastructure explains part of the disparity.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 734}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    These findings provide support for Hypothesis 1 for Black and Latino clustering (not Asian clustering). Moreover, this negative association is partially explained by the existing distribution of health care resources across communities, especially hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices. The presence of these establishments is associated with a higher number of vaccine sites, so the lack of these sites in segregated communities means fewer vaccine sites for these areas. However, we do not observe the same association for pharmacies and retirement communities. Indeed, the association for retirement communities is actually significant and negative and appears to have a suppression effect with the racial-ethnic clustering scores. We speculate that this may be because these groups are less likely to use retirement homes for elderly relatives as other work suggests (Dilworth- Anderson, Williams, and Gibson 2002), although we cannot directly test this assertion with the data here. These findings provide partial support for Hypothesis 2, with stronger evidence for the case of Latino clustering.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices\u2014but not pharmacies\u2014were positively linked to vaccine-site availability, helping explain disparities tied to Black and Latino clustering.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 736}

In our study, area-level median income was not significant in the first analysis, and in the second analysis, it was significant and negative, meaning that higher income areas were less likely to receive doses. Thus, the story seems to be more about race specifically rather than class, which limited research has also shown (Anderson 2017; Small and McDermott 2006).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The analyses indicate that neighborhood income, rather than race, was the primary determinant of where vaccine resources were distributed.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 737}

Black clustering is again significant and negatively associated with the number of vaccine doses per 10,000 people in a ZIP code over a 9-week period (although this is only significant for Latino clustering at the .1 level), meaning that minority segregated communities were less likely to receive doses of vaccine over this period. This provides further partial support for Hypothesis 1 in the case of Black clustering. And, again, these results are somewhat attenuated with the inclusion of the number of hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices. Both these types of establishments are strongly associated with a higher number of vaccine doses, and they reduce the size of the coefficient for Black clustering. Thus, we find partial support for Hypothesis 2.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Even after adjusting for other factors, Black clustered neighborhoods received fewer vaccine doses, but this gap shrank once hospital and physician office counts were included.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 738}

We also divided this number by the population size and multiplied by 100,000 to derive a rate per 100,000 people. Beyond the mere availability of a vaccine site, we also examined the distribution of vaccine doses per 10,000 people to each site for each week of the 9-week period.

Maternal health reflects an average of the pooled estimates across the five study waves. Results demonstrate the educational gradient in maternal health. As mothers\u2019 baseline level of educational attainment increased, their overall self-rated health increased, and their reports of parenting stress, having poor mental health, and having recently smoked decreased. The rate of smoking was four times greater for mothers with less than a high school degree than for mothers with a bachelor\u2019s degree (36% vs. 8%). Differences in mental health were also noteworthy, albeit smaller (26% vs. 14%). Patterns for overall health represented a 55% of a standard deviation (overall SD = 1.05) difference between mothers with the highest and lowest levels of education.

These models did not yield significant results. Finally, I explored (6) the potential for indirect effects, focusing on income, which is likely to be a main driver in mothers\u2019 decisions to return to school. These analyses used mediation tests in structural equation modeling that extended the lagged models. In short, while income at Wave 6 was significantly associated with all four concurrent health outcomes, it did not significantly mediate the link between vocational degree or associate\u2019s degree attainment and maternal health. It did significantly mediate the association with Wave 5 bachelor\u2019s degree attainment, but the size of the indirect effects were small (see Appendix C in the online version of the arti- cle). Taken in combination with the small coefficient size and insignificant direct effect for bachelor\u2019s degree completion, these results suggest that this small positive mediating effect of greater income is likely offset by other negative mediating factors (for a methodological discussion, see Zhao, Lynch, and Chen 2010).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Household income fully mediated the positive relationship between completing a bachelor\u2019s degree and improved maternal health.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 749}

These data function to produce and reinforce biases about patients that then inform provider practices. Scientific arguments have long been used to encourage and validate eugenicist beliefs about who should reproduce, especially regarding women of color (Roberts 1997). In its more modern and implicit form, such claims hinge on references to aggregated data about contraceptive efficacy and women most at risk for unintended pregnancies. These data prompt providers to anticipate certain patient risks and contraceptive needs. Kathleen, a white nurse midwife, explains:\n\nYoung women I am more likely to dissuade from using pills [b]ecause of research.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Like I have heard anything from 84 to 89% [efficacy]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I mean I have been here for a long time and at times it really feels Third World and (pauses) just it seems like especially with teenagers\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009where I worked before, that [pregnancy] was almost celebrated.

Figure 2 illustrates these patterns. As shown, formerly incarcerated individuals who did not report direct violence are roughly 9 months (12 \u00d7 .776) older biologically than expected based on their chronological age. Those who did report direct violence during incarceration are approximately 2 years and 2 months (12 \u00d7 2.164) older biologically than expected based on their chronological age. These results indicate that the direct experiences with violence during incarceration moderate the association between incarceration exposure and the speed of aging. Secondary violence, however, does not moderate the association (see Model 4), suggesting that witnessing violence may not exacerbate the already stressful incarceration experience for African American adults.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Directly experiencing violence while incarcerated further accelerated biological aging, whereas merely witnessing violence did not add additional risk.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 764}

There is no black-white or Hispanic-white paradox, though in basic multivariate models (see Table 3), a significant difference emerges. Table 2 shows large racial-ethnic differ- ences in the use of medications with side effects. About 60% of non-Hispanic whites do not use medications with depression as a side effect, but this percentage is much higher among minorities, espe- cially Asians and Hispanics. About 5% of whites use three or more such medications, relative to slightly over 4% of blacks, 1% of Asians, and 2% of Hispanics. The same pattern is found for drugs involving suicide as a side effect, though the racial- ethnic differences are, if anything, larger. About 72% of whites use no such medications, relative to 85% of blacks, 91% of Asians, and 87% of Hispanics.

Furthermore, racial-ethnic differences in distress are different within the rows denoting the use of no drugs with side effects.

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    The regression models presented in Table 4 explore the consequences of such medications for the minority advantage in mental health. Pairs of models are presented for each model specification, the first using linear regression for the K6 summary score and the second using logit regression for the categorical coding of the K6. The use of control variables is critical both for understanding the magnitude of the paradox and for contextualizing the influence of pharmaceutical use. The baseline model controls for socioeconomic status (as well as other variables) and shows a minority advantage, both with respect to a dimensional measure of distress and a categorical one. The magnitude of the difference is large, with minorities showing at least a 20% reduction in the odds of reporting significant distress. The second pair of models inserts controls for each of the chronic health conditions. As expected, this adjustment alters the magnitude of the racial-ethnic differences, though in ways spe- cific to each racial-ethnic group. The black-white difference is suppressed somewhat by physical health, such that the black advantage would be even larger\u2014about 7% larger for the K6 score\u2014were it not for a black disadvantage in physical health. For both Hispanics and Asians, however, the inclusion of controls for chronic conditions explains some of the apparent mental health advantage. The Asian advantage for the K6 is reduced by about 67%, whereas the Hispanic advantage is reduced by 46%. The difference between Hispanics and whites in significant distress, meanwhile, is reduced to statistical nonsignificance.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    After adjusting for chronic health conditions, the Hispanic advantage in the continuous K6 score disappears entirely.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 772}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    The next two models introduce controls for the use of pharmaceuticals involving depression and suicide as side-effects. In the first pair of models (Model 3), the count of medicines involving suicide includes antidepressants, but in the second pair (Model 4), the count excludes them. The inclusion of the side-effect variables explains what remains of much of the racial-ethnic advantage. Although the black-white difference in the K6 summary remains significant and shows a black advantage, it is reduced a great deal, by 60%, relative to Model 1. The difference in significant distress, meanwhile, is reduced to statistical nonsignificance. A similar pattern is found for the Asian-white difference, and in fact, the Asian advantage in the K6 turns into a significant Asian disadvantage. Similarly, the Hispanic advantage with respect to significant distress in Model 1 is reversed in Model 4, turning into a significant Hispanic disadvantage. Formal tests of mediation using structural equations and the contin- ued K6 outcome provide further evidence for medi- ation. In Model 3, the indirect effect of black was \u2013.359 (p < .001), and the direct effect was \u2013.214  (p < .001). The parallel effects for Asians and Hispanics were, respectively, \u2013.375 (p < .001) and .235 (p < .001) and \u2013.222 (p < .001) and \u2013.031  (p = .583). In Model 4, similar patterns of signifi- cance among direct and indirect effects were found with the exception of the direct effect of Asian was no longer significant (b = .103, p = .115) and the direct effect of Hispanic emerged as borderline sig- nificant (b = \u2013.122, p = .037).\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    When medication side-effect controls are added, the black\u2013white gap in significant distress actually grows larger rather than shrinking.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 773}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    These patterns are due in part to the particularly powerful relationship between drugs with suicide as a side effect and the risk of significant distress, especially when using three or more such medications. Taking three or more medications with suicide as a side effect results in an increase in the odds of significant distress by a factor of more than 10. Even one such medication more than doubles the odds of significant distress. Drugs with depression as a side effect are consequential, too, though the relationship is considerably weaker than it is for suicide. To be sure, some of the relationship between drugs with suicide as a side effect and significant distress could be driven by the inclusion of antidepressants in the count. Such drugs involve suicide as a side effect and therefore are relevant to considering nonspecific psychological distress, but such drugs obviously do not involve depression as a side effect. The next pair of models eliminates antidepressants from the count. This reduces the rela- tionship between drugs with suicide as a side effect and the risk of significant distress, though it does not reduce the relationship by much. For instance, in the K6 models, the coefficient for three or more such drugs is reduced by only 3% between Models 3 and 4. Moreover, pharmaceutical side effects con- tinue to explain the racial-ethnic minority advan- tage with respect to significant distress. The mediating effect for the black-white difference in the K6 score is weaker than for Model 3, though side effects still explain 32% of the difference.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Using three or more drugs that have suicide listed as a side effect raises the odds of significant psychological distress by more than ten times.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 774}

Use only the given evidence.\n\n    Scientific Text:\n    There are other ways to explore unobserved het- erogeneity with respect to health. It is possible that drugs involving depression or suicide as a side effect have no more of a relationship with the K6 than drugs that do not have depression or suicide as a side effect\u2014that the entire relationship between pharmaceutical use and the K6 is driven by under- lying treated illness. Other studies have explored this possibility and found that drugs without depres- sion or suicide as a side effect are statistically unre- lated to depression (Qato et al. 2018), though it is important to see if the same holds true in the present study, which uses both a different data set and a dif- ferent outcome. Model 2 suggests other drugs have a significant relationship with the K6, too, though the magnitude of the relationship is much weaker than it is for drugs involving suicide as a side effect. For each pair-wise coefficient comparison (i.e., one medication with suicide as a side effect is equal to one drug with neither depression nor suicide as a side effect), the difference is statistically significant at p < .001.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Model 2 shows that medications without depression or suicide side effects have no significant association with psychological distress.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 775}

This research sheds light on these dynamics and provides evidence in support of Hypothesis 1, demonstrating that specific life patterns, such as entrepreneur familist, may lead to a lower risk of depression, reflecting how the unfolding of life trajectories in work\u2013family dimensions can shape mental health later in life. The accumulation of self-employment throughout the life course together with the formation of a traditional family can enhance mental health through the existence of emotional backing, a feeling of safety, and hands-on help, all of which are essential for managing life challenges brought by self-employment (Cohen and Wills 1985). These insights emphasize the importance of considering the overall influence of these trajectories on mental health and how societal norms and institutions may promote specific life paths that could adversely affect individual well-being when not adhered to.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    The study concludes that the entrepreneur familist trajectory is associated with an elevated risk of depression for women.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "CONTRADICT", "id": 829}

In addition, \nthe predicted probability of women reporting expen-\nsive medical tests was 40% in states high in sexism, \ncompared to 25% in states with low sexism scores. \nA similar pattern was observed for women\u2019s report-\ning of expensive prescriptions (38% in high-sexism \nstates compared to 23% in low-sexism states). \nAmong men, the predicted probability of reporting \naffordability barriers showed little change as state-\nlevel sexism increased, remaining within 3 percent-\nage points from the lowest state-level sexism score \nto the highest for each barrier.\n\n    Claimed Finding:\n    Model predictions indicate that nearly half of women in high-sexism states are expected to be unable to pay medical bills versus roughly one-third in low-sexism states.\n\n    Answer (SUPPORT / CONTRADICT):", "answer": "SUPPORT", "id": 836}
