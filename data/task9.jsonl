First, we designed one respective tariff scenario recovering the network costs through only one of the three components\u2014volume, fixed charge and measured peak load (average and maximum). Scenario f100 is a 100% fixed charge. Thereby, f100 represents a flat charge for all households, which is \u20ac 136,209.10 / 765 households =\u20ac 178.05 per household per year for the full sample in our study. Scenario pa100 represents a scheme charging for measured peak load only. In this scenario, the definition of kW peak load follows the Austrian tariff structure in 201648, where a so-called smart meter tariff was included for testing only (in the residential sector). There, kW peak load as relevant for billing is not defined as  the one maximum load out of the 35,040 metered load values during one year  per Austrian meter. Peak load as relevant for setting a household's peak charge  is defined as the average of the 12 monthly peak loads during the respective  year. Scenario pa100 for the full sample analysis therefore sets  \u20ac 136,209.10 / 3,485.59 kW total =\u20ac 39.07 per kW of billing relevant peak load, where kW total is the sum over all 765 corresponding peak-load values. Scenario pm100 also represents a scheme charging for peak demand only, but instead of averaging, the highest of the 12 monthly peaks is applied, such that it sets \u20ac 136,209.10 / 4,603.3 kW total =\u20ac 29.59 per kW of billing relevant peak load, where kW total is the sum over all 765 corresponding peak-load values. Scenario e100 is a fully volumetric tariff and includes only a payment  per unit of consumed energy. Thereby it is \u20ac 136,209.10 / 2,691,272 kWh total = \u20ac 0.0506 per kWh consumed during the respective year, where kWh total is  the aggregated electricity consumption of all 765 households.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 1}

However, standard controls within OLS regressions may not be adequate if there is insufficient overlap, or balance, in the distributions of characteristics between diagnosed and undiagnosed children (Imbens and Rubin 2015). Researchers have turned to matching techniques to help achieve sample balance on key variables for which OLS models may yield estimates that lack sample support/balance (Gangl 2010). This study used two types of matching to obtain estimates that are \u201cdoubly robust\u201d to confounding between diagnosed and undiagnosed children: coarsened exact matching (CEM) and propensity score matching (PSM) (Stuart et al. 2009). First, I use CEM to preprocess the data and ensure sample balance on three key factors that shape both diagnosis and the outcomes: family social class group (given the study's theoretical motivation), severity quartile of prediagnosis behavioral problems (a key confounder of diagnostic effects), and child sex (since sex differences in children's presentation of ADHDrelated behaviors could produce improper matches given greater diagnosis of the hyperactive subtype among boys).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 2}

We only included project announcements for electrolysers that included a year of project launch, had a meaningful status (not 'Other' or 'Other/Unknown') and reported a capacity value. We did not filter for the type of electricity as this was often unknown. These criteria led to 612 projects in the 2021 snapshot, 877 projects in the 2022 snapshot and 1,265 projects in the 2023 snapshot. In the 2023 snapshot, only a single status category was reported for projects that were either under construction or had an FID ('FID/Construction'). To ensure consistent status categories across all snapshots, we merged the 'FID' and 'Under construction' categories in the 2021 and 2022 snapshots. Projects with a 'DEMO' status were allocated as 'Operational', 'FID/Construction' or 'Decommissioned', depending on whether they were still running, announced for the future or had been decommissioned, respectively. We note that the 'Concept' category is very broadly defined with an unspecified credibility bar for inclusion, while the 'Feasibility study' category may also contain projects for which a feasibility study is planned, but has not yet started. Confidential projects were distributed to all regions in proportion to the share of capacity from non-confidential projects, but could not be tracked across database snapshots.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 3}

In addition, in 168 of the rooms, the average flow rate per shower was also measured. Using the data stored on the device, energy consumption can be converted to water consumption and vice versa. Given the high correlation between water and energy consumption per shower (0.989)25, the choice of the unit of analysis does not change the results in any meaningful way. This article focuses on resource consumption in units of energy in kilowatt hours. The raw data set included observations of 25,647 measured showers from 269 hotel rooms at 6 different hotels (see Data availability). In a first pre-processing step, the data were cleaned by removing outliers from malfunctioning devices; to this end, observations that deviated by over 3 standard deviations from the mean  of the energy consumed or water volume per shower were removed from the  sample\u2014that is, only observations in the interval [ -x . . + x . . x x 3 sd, 3 sd ] were retained. Furthermore, we removed data points that most likely did not represent showers\u2014for example water extractions of volumes below 6.5 litres and observations deviating over 2 standard deviations from average temperature, which probably represent cleaning or other procedures. A member of the research team accompanied cleaning personnel at one hotel for several hours to gather information on cleaning practices to identify water extractions for cleaning. The specific choice of 6.5 litres was based on this assessment; we conducted robustness checks in which we changed this threshold to other values (5 litres or 10 litres), which generated very similar results. After this pre-processing step, the final data set included 19,596 showers from 265 hotel rooms (11,384 observations in the treatment group and 8,218 in the control group). The average flow rate per shower could be measured only for 168 rooms and 8,824 observations, so only these data points are included in the estimation of models (2) and (3) in Table 2. Since the study is a natural field experiment with uninformed participants, we were not able to collect socio-demographic data about the guests who stayed in the rooms with the smart shower meters during the study.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 7}

To create the with-intent group, we exclude all subscriptions associated with the academic sector as well as those subscriptions created by staff from WRI or affiliates (together these constitute the without-intent subscriptions). The end result is a total of 558 subscriptions with intent and 734 without. The number of grid cells ever covered by a subscription with intent is 399,660, whereas those that have ever been covered by a subscription without intent total 298,574. Of the 558 subscriptions with intent, 302 declared their primary job responsibility using a drop down menu within the alerts system. Supplementary Table B22 details these responses. The majority of these were GIS specialists, with a relatively large number of programme managers, technical staff, land-use planning specialist, reporters, and forest/park managers.

Each polygon of the layer corresponds to a subscribed area with a date of initiation of the subscription.

Specifically, we applied a logarithmic transformation to the EUI data and filtered outlier values that fell outside the threshold of two standard deviations from the mean58. Second, using the unique Borough Block Lot property identifier, we merged energy and building attribute data with tax lot and zoning information provided by the NYC's Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output database to identify additional building characteristics, such as assessed value. Finally, we integrated NATure eNergYthe merged dataset with information from individual audit reports submitted to the Department of Buildings as per LL87 requirements to identify properties that conducted an energy audit in calendar years 2013 or 2014, and to analyse buildingspecific ECM recommendations and savings potentials.After our data processing steps, we analysed whether the audited properties in our sample demonstrated larger percentage reductions in site EUI between the pre- and postaudit period than those of similar buildings that did not perform an audit during the study period. We defined the EUI percentage change for each building as the difference between the mean EUI during the two years prior to the audit (2011 and 2012) and the two years after the audit (2015 and 2016). We used the two-year average to account for anomalous variations in building energy consumption that could occur in a given year (for example, Hurricane Sandy had a non-trivial impact on energy use in buildings in the impacted areas in 2012). We focused on multifamily and office buildings, as the two types account for more than 90% of the total LL84 covered properties by quantity and aggregate energy consumption.

Thus, mothers with technical/trade degrees were included in the \u201csome college group,\u201d but I did use this information in models that restrict the sample based on mothers' baseline education (explained in the following). At each follow-up wave, women reported whether they had earned a higher education degree among a variety of institution types (e.g., technical degree, secretarial school, associate's degree, etc.) since the last interview. Using this information, I created three time-varying, binary variables for completed a vocational program, completed an associate's degree, and completed a bachelor's degree. Once mothers reported degree completion, mothers were assigned a value of 1 on that measure for all subsequent waves. This coding technique captured a pooled estimate of the association between additional education and health that used all available data and provided an average of mothers' health before versus after completing additional education. Mothers were also asked if they had enrolled in school since the last interview, but only where they had enrolled during Waves 2 to 5. I used this information to create a parallel set of bivariate measures of enrolled in a vocational program, enrolled in an associate's program, and enrolled in a bachelor's degree program for ancillary analyses exploring the impact of school enrollment (restricted to Waves 2-5).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 15}

It is dynamic recursive with myopic foresight (that is, the model solution in each model period depends on the conditions in that period or periods before it). In this study, we use GCAM-USA v5.1, which is a version of GCAM with state-level detail in the United States26. Like GCAM, GCAM-USA is an open-source model. Detailed documentation for the GCAM-USA model is available online (http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/gcam-usa.html). Here we summarize key model features that are relevant for this study. The model results for all main and supplementary scenarios are available from a public data repository51. GCAM-USA divides the energy and economic systems of the United States into 50 states and Washington DC, with state-level representation of socioeconomics, energy transformation (power generation and refining), carbon storage, renewable resources (wind and solar), electricity markets (with the representation of regional electricity grids) and consumer end-use energy demands (in buildings, transportation and industrial sectors).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 20}

First, for the number of vaccine distribution sites, we estimated a series of spatial error models. We calculated univariate global Moran's I statistics for our key independent variables that suggested that spatial autocorrelation was a problem and would therefore not meet the assumptions of ordineary least squares (OLS) regression. Furthermore, the LaGrange multiplier statistics indicated that the spatial error model was the most appropriate method to contend with this autocorrelation (Anselin, Florax, and Rey 2004). Specifically, we used a queen spatial weight matrix because this was found to best maximize global Moran's I for each of the key variables used in the models (Anselin 1995; Anselin, Florax, and Rey 2004). We also included Kelejian and Prucha (2010) robust standard errors to account for significant heteroscedasticity. However, of note, the term for lambda is not significant in the models presented in Table 2, suggesting that correlated errors in omitted variables may not be particularly a problem here. The OLS results were also virtually identical to what is presented here in terms of the sign, significance, and relative effect sizes for each of our variables. Because spatial autocorrelation was significant in our preliminary analyses, though, we chose to present the results as spatial error models.

The total modelled emissions from electricity generation in the year 2015 for EU ETS countries covered by LIMES-EU amount to 981 Mt CO2, closely aligning with the historical emissions of 967 Mt CO2reported by Mantsos et al.56 Because emissions from industry, heating and aviation are also calibrated to match their historical 2015 levels (as described in LIMES-EU documentation52), this calibration ensures that our model generates meaningful values for total emissions in the 2015 time step. Also, the model-endogenous investments in 2015 lead to standing capacities in 2020 that match historic wind and solar capacities in 2020. To this aim, we additionally assume subsidies for electricity generated from solar or wind sources (\u20ac0.04 kWh-1 for solar and \u20ac0.015 kWh-1 for wind) to represent the various renewable subsidies that were in place in most EU member states.

However, significant uncertainty remains, not the least of which surrounds the actual costs of these projects, for which there are conflicting reports21,33,34. Furthermore this 'top-down' look gives little insight into the relative impact of different cost-cutting mechanisms, and therefore provides little grounding for assessing whether these prices can be transferred to other markets; and as many of the details are proprietary, it would in fact not be feasible to attempt an exact reconstruction of any particular project. To circumvent this challenge, we adopted a bottom-up modelling approach, quantifying cost components based on a range of industry reports and analysis to build up a model of how these prices could be achieved under realistic global and local conditions.  This allows us to look at the relative impact of the many factors that contribute to the ultimate cost of producing electricity. Performance modelling was performed in System Advisor Model (SAM) for a plant designed to match the known specifications of Dubai's MBR solar park, phase 3, the first of the sub-3\u00a2 kWh-1 projects. The 'baseline' model scaled down the MBR model to 100MWac while retaining the same assumptions about hardware costs. LCOE was calculated in a spreadsheet (available on request) as: = +\u2211 \u2211 = + = + C LCOE i N O r i N E r 1 (1 ) 1 (1 ) i i i i using the annual energy yield calculated by SAM and discounting by the weighted average cost of capital.

Generally speaking, do you approve or disapprove of [France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States] joining such an agreement?\u201d Respondents were asked to answer on a scale from 1 (strongly approve) to 10 (strongly disapprove).

The preferences for distributing climate costs over time, shown in Fig. 2, were calculated as the share of respondents who selected a particular time path. We investigated the role of different individual-level covariates using a multinomial probit regression. The four possible values of the outcome variable corresponded to the four time path options available to respondents.

In this way, rule-making is one of the first and most critical steps of the policy implementation process. Rule-making is also a critical site to analyse the operationalization of climate justice on the ground. Rule-making is where issues of politics and power most clearly intersect with policy implementation by providing an arena for city governments and other actors to contest and reinterpret the justice goals and mandates that were already embedded in climate policies during the policy planning process72.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 39}

We first excluded 28 energy generators and utilities (3% of the initial sample) due to our focus on companies that purchase energy. We excluded another 101 companies (12% of the initial sample) that only have intensity-based SBTs covering scope 2 to avoid the additional uncertainty associated with converting intensity targets to absolute emission targets. For companies with multiple SBTs covering different emissions scopes and target years, we selected a single SBT, prioritizing targets specifically for scope 2, when available (otherwise, we prioritized targets for scopes 1 and 2 combined over targets for scopes 1, 2 and 3 combined), followed by prioritization of the shortest target time span (that is, the difference between the base year and target year). In addition to the target data sourced from SBTi, we collected information on the scope 2 accounting approach that each SBT refers to (market- or location-based) from company disclosures to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project)40 (this information is not provided by SBTi; see Supplementary Section 2.4 for more details). Note, however, that only around half of companies with approved SBTs reported to CDP.

Adaptation of the agricultural sector to climate-induced changes in crop yields may include adjustments in consumption, production and international trade2. Demand-side adaptation is captured in GLOBIOM by changes in regional consumption levels in response to market prices. Supply-side adaptation includes the reallocation of land for each crop by a grid-cell and management system, and the expansion of cropland to other land covers23. Whereas Lecl\u00e8re et al.23 assess supply-side adaptation, here we focused on international market responses, in which our analysis approach is inspired by the 'adaptation illusion hypothesis' postulated by Lobell15 and confirmed by Moore et al.55. They argue that farm-level practices identified as adaptation measures by many crop modelling studies cannot be referred to as climate adaptation as they have the same yield impact in current climate as under climate change. In a similar manner, we intended to investigate whether, where and, if so, why trade integration has a larger positive impact on the risk of hunger under climate change. We defined the adaptation effect of trade as the sum of the effect of reducing trade costs on hunger under current climate (direct trade effect), and any additional positive or negative impact of trade integration under climate change (climate-induced trade effect). The adaptation effect of trade can be understood through Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage (Supplementary Text)11,12. Reducing trade costs promotes trade according to comparative advantage56 and facilitates the role of trade as a transmission belt in linking food-deficit and food-surplus regions57. Climate change impacts differ across crops and regions8. Depending on the spatial distribution of these impacts, the current pattern of comparative advantage may be intensified, maintained or substantially altered. This may lead to increased food deficits in certain regions. Trade is argued to have a larger role under climate change as it facilitates adjustment to changes in comparative advantage11,12 and enables food surplus to be linked with food deficit regions6,7,57.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 42}

In a first step, respondents were asked whether they hold a preference for a specific party. If they replied in the affirmative (which was the case for 1,275 respondents, or 64% of the main sample), they were then asked which of the seven parties represented in the lower house of the German parliament they identify with, or whether they preferred another party. To measure perceived scientific consensus, respondents were asked to indicate the percentage of climate scientists worldwide who think that the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to human activity. They used a slider to choose a percentage between 0 and 100%.

Demographic controls included age, year of birth, sex, race (White, Black, other), and four-category census region of residence (Northeast, South, Midwest, West). We included two measures of marital status: total years married and whether the respondent is married in a particular wave. We included an indicator of whether a respondent had a college degree by the age of 40.4 We included three health-related measures: the respondent's retrospective self-assessment of general health at ages 0 to 16,5 smoking status at ages 60 to 79, and the proportion of observed waves that a respondent had health insurance from 1999 onward, the first year health insurance information is consistently available. We included eight measures of contemporary and career employment. First, we included measures of a respondent's employment status at ages 60+: working, retired, unemployed, or not in the labor force. Second, we included the respondent's ages 60+ posttax and transfer total household income, divided by the square root of the number of household members. Third, we constructed 19 industry categories following Western and Rosenfeld (2011) and assigned respondents the modal category we observe at ages 18 to 60. Appendix materials in the online version of the article include replication with percentage waves in industry categories.

First, we evaluated two scenarios of the spatial distribution of rainfall in causing flooding within the Warren area. For this purpose, STORM2014 precipitation data were configured as a grid with a resolution of 500 m x 500 m using rainfall data obtained from the Detroit City Airport rain gauge. This gridded product was used as model input in the first scenario, 'HR-Integrated' (results are presented in Fig. 2d). The drainage system was designed to closely resemble realworld conditions, allowing for water exchange between the inside and outside of the Warren drainage system based on the dynamically changing distribution of hydraulic head over the surface and below ground in storm sewers. In the second scenario, the gridded rainfall data for the Warren area were set to 0 mm for the duration of the STORM2014 event (that is, 24 h). This scenario was named 'NR-Integrated' (Fig. 2e). In the second experiment, we explored the functioning of two stormwater sewer outfalls (Fig. 2b,c) using three different model configurations. The first set-up represents the most realistic design  by allowing backwater to occur (water from the open channel flows back into the sewer system through the outfall) (termed 'Integrated' outfalls). The second set-up assumes the current sewer system is  unaffected by water levels at the outfall locations, maximizing drainage  capacity by allowing unrestricted discharge from the stormwater  system into the open channel without backflow from Bear Creek (termed 'Controlled' outfalls). The third set-up precludes any water exchange at the outfalls between the stormwater system and open channel, with the total outflow from the system stored in an underground storage  sized to contain all runoff from the Red Run watershed under  the STORM2014 event (a volume of ~24.77 million m3) rather than entering the open channel. We term this case 'Water loss', the results of which are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 45}

We started the analysis in 2008 because this is the year when Secure Communities was launched and funding for 287(g) dramatically expanded\u2014two programs that involve local law enforcement in immigration enforcement and have been critical to the rise in deportations following a traffic stop (Moinester 2019). These programs contribute to immigrants' fears of driving without a license and, in turn, may be consequential for perinatal health (Rhodes et al. 2015). The target population for this study was Mexican and Central American birthing people who were likely to be impacted by the passage of a license law. We believe that undocumented birthing people would be most strongly impacted because they would personally receive an additional privilege and reduction in deportation risk because of the implementation of this law. The impact of these laws may also spill over to birthing people who are not themselves undocumented but whose partner or other loved ones are. These persons may experience a reduction in stress because of the passage of the laws or increase in financial resources due to changes for others in their household. Legal status is not included in birth certificate data. However, to make the study population more likely to be undocumented or have undocumented partners or loved ones, we restricted the analysis to birthing people born in Central America or Mexico. These regions account for 67% of the U.S. undocumented population (Migration Policy Institute 2019).

To capture stranded asset risks, we used both a measure of the size of a financial sector and the approximate carbon exposure of the country's GDP. First, we used the World Bank DataBank's domestic credit provided to the private sector measure, as a share of GDP, from the most recent full coverage year in 2019 as a proxy for financial sector size53. This measure is a commonly used proxy for financial depth, which captures the financial sector's size relative to the domestic economy54. We also calculated the economic value contributing to a country's GDP from the oil and gas sector for the year 2021, using the Global Resource Input-Output Assessment model, a multiregional input-output database that captures input and intermediate goods trade across the world55. This dataset includes not just economic value produced and traded, but also value added by each economy into the value of final goods. This measure best captures the economic value the oil and gas sector contributes to an economy. For data on the growth of the renewable energy sector across countries, we used yearly data from the International Energy Agency on renewable energy's percentage share of primary energy supply and calculated the growth rate from 2018 to 202156. We used the 2022 exposure component of the ND-Gain country index to capture a country's physical risk of climate change impacts57. To measure climate policy stringency, we used the OECD's Climate Policy Stringency of adopted policies index for the most recent year available, 202058. To capture public sentiment about climate change, we used data from the YPCCC's survey, conducted in 2022, that produced population breakdowns of sentiment on climate change, by percentage59. We grouped the alarmed and concerned audiences together to capture the share of the population concerned about climate change. This survey is the most comprehensive cross-country sampling of public sentiment about climate change so far, but it still is missing a handful of countries from our dataset, most notably China and Russia. We substitute in a data point for China from a comparable 2022 survey from the International Monetary Fund, which includes the share of the population that feels that climate change will affect them or their family now up through the next 10 years60.

We convert the income variable into a dummy value by bifurcating the records into households that earn more or less than the state median income. The coefficient of interest is \u03b2, which represents the statistical association between household demographics and the household's adoption choice. Note that the model is not designed for causal inference. Household adoption choices are probably driven by numerous idiosyncratic factors that could correlate with the demographic factors. The purpose of this model is to compare the relative weights of the \u03b2 coefficients to understand which demographic dimensions are most strongly associated with household adoption choices. We use state random effects to account for the possibility that community solar has distinct impacts on adopter demographics in different states with distinct policy contexts. In addition to comparing the coefficients, we also implement variations of the model in equation (1) with different combinations of the demographic factors. We then compare Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values across those models (Supplementary Table 6). The AIC is a metric that simultaneously measures prediction accuracy while penalizing models with more variables. The AIC comparisons provide another way of comparing the relative contributions of demographic differences to household adoption choices.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 56}

Second, we focus on Germany, one of the earliest markets to adopt these technologies. Germany added the most solar PV capacity in 13 of the 17 years analysed, and the most wind onshore capacity in 8 of the 17 years analysed46. Our sample period begins in 2000, when Germany enacted its landmark legislation on renewable energy sources (EEG), with a feed-in tariff that triggered large-scale renewable energy investments23. The feed-in tariff was never changed retroactively. The German electricity market has been liberalized since 199823, and the vast majority of investment in RET was private47. Third, we restrict the analysis to project finance structures, exploiting the fact that 96% of large solar PV projects and 88% of large wind onshore projects in Germany between 2000 and 2015 were undertaken using project finance24\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 58}

Five measures were derived from the various questions on the survey. (1) Likelihood to adopt each archetype, using a single question asked after each archetype, was scored on a number of sematic differential attribute scales. (2) Adoption spread was the highest value of likely minus the lowest for each individual to generate a signal of preference certainty. If a person scored one or more options very highly in terms of likelihood to adopt, and another option very low, they would have a larger spread than someone who scored all options similarly. (3) Probability of adoption was the number of times chosen during the paired comparison experiments divided by the number of times available to be chosen. (4) Weighted probability of adoption was calculated by multiplying the probability of adoption score by the likelihood score. (5) Preference stability was a test of internal consistency calculated by using an excel macro to detect reversals between each combination of three options and then adding up the number per person.

Potential inhomogeneities caused by (1) cost or price type, (2) application type or (8) integration level are harmonized based on studies that explicitly state multiple values differentiated according to (1), (2), (8). Hence, all cost values were topped with a 35% surcharge (median value from battery data as no temporal trend could be identified) to derive OEM purchase prices. Scaling automotive-certified components to HDV-certified ones, data showed a temporal trend for batteries but not for fuel cells. Hence, we used a decreasing scaling factor for batteries from around 80% in 2020 to 50% in 2030 and 20% in 2050, indicating higher integration, potential enhancements through on-purpose designs and usable synergies. For fuel cells, all automotive-type values were topped with a 100% surcharge (median value). For cell-to-system or stack-to-system scaling, data showed a clear temporal trend for both batteries and fuel cells. Therefore, we used a decreasing scaling for batteries from around 40% in 2020 to 30% in 2030 and 20% in 2050. In contrast, we used an increasing scaling factor for fuel cells from 60% in 2020 to 90% in 2030 and 125% in 2050, meaning that the cost share of the actual stacks on total system costs was expected to decrease.

Specifically, we extended the quantitative trade and MP model developed by refs. 11,12, by incorporating corporate tax and linking production to environmental emissions. In the model, a firm from country i can serve country n by building an affiliate (MP) in country l and shipping goods to country n (Trade). This entails MP costs associated with the pair {i, l} and trade costs associated with the pair {l, n}. Given these costs between countries, a firm in any country chooses how much of its products will serve market n, and via which production location it will serve market n to maximize profit. Then, a corporate tax cut in country B would increase the profits of the production located in B and attract more MP activities and stimulate more trade flows from B. The expansion of production in B would directly increase the CO2 emissions through a scale effect. It would also increase labor demand and lift the wage level in B, as labor is a necessary input in production. However, the wage change in B would further reshape MP flows to B and trade flows from B by influencing marginal production costs. Meanwhile, tax cuts in B would impact output and emissions in B and other countries. For example, the tax cut in B will decrease the income of its competitors by taking up their market share. In other words, corporate tax cuts in one country would impact both MP and trade flows across countries and reshape global production and emission networks.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 69}

We use this annual measure of deforestation (rather than the sum of alerts for that year) because the alerts are reliant on single observations (making them more susceptible to error) and are designed to be conservative, whereas the annual product maps loss are based on the entire year and can capture the area of loss more accurately9. We prefer a binary measure of deforestation that is equal to one if there is a positive amount of deforestation during a given year. The reason for this is that the two continuous outcomes (per cent deforested and a winsorized version of per cent deforested) have substantial outliers, even in the case of the winsorized measure. For example, the per cent deforestation outcome ranges from zero to 100. However, the measure at the 75th percentile is zero, and at the 95th, 3.57. For the winsorized version of this variable, the 75th percentile value is still zero, and the 95th is 3.29.

To do so, we estimate a model that relates adoption of a policy in a country i at time t to the adoption of the same policy in other countries j = 1, \u2026, Nc , j ! = i prior to time t (with Nc being the number of countries in the sample). This is a common  empirical strategy to identify policy diffusion and has been used in the literature on climate policy7,20,21,41. Technically, the model accounts for the mutual influences between countries with spatial lags, which  are calculated as a weighted average of prior policy adoption in all  other countries. We use alternative weighting schemes based on geographical proximity, trade and international institutional linkages, which we consider as representing some of the alternative diffusion mechanisms cited in the main text. The choice of our model is informed by two characteristics of our dependent variable. The first characteristic is that any possible future policy adoption is unobserved, which means that our dependent variable is right-censored. Specifically, at the time of analysis, policy adoption is only recorded in the Carbon Pricing Dashboard of the World Bank up until April 2022, which means that 2021 is the most recent year in our sample. The second characteristic is that our dependent variable is binary, taking on only values 0 or 1.

In experiment 1, we examine 24 project dimensions in a demographically representative sample of PA residents. In experiment 2, we examine a reduced set of 19 dimensions in a smaller sample of local elected officials. We use a limited number of attributes and increase the number of choice pairs that respondents evaluate, to ensure that we are powered to detect 0.07 and 0.05 effect sizes despite the smaller sample size. We selected attributes to drop on the basis of the results of experiment 1 (for example, eliminating attribute levels that did not have statistically significant variation, like in project benefits, and adding an additional attribute level in response to feedback from researchers experienced with elite samples). We asked respondents to choose between two energy infrastructure projects in their area that varied on five dimensions. The full list of attributes is displayed in Supplementary Table 5. In experiment 2, we additionally asked local elected officials to report their perceptions of constituent support for each proposed pair of projects.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 77}

First, startups that did not have a clear connection to climate were identified and excluded from the dataset. This was done using keyword terms in the description, such as startups focused on ride sharing for which the climate benefit is unclear. Supplementary Table 17 provides all filtering terms. Competitors of these excluded ventures, as identified by i3, were also excluded. In addition, startups that i3 categorized in the 'other clean tech' sector were excluded unless they were described by a relevant keyword indicating a clear climate mitigation link (Supplementary Table 17). Manual verification revealed that many of these ventures were technology firms with minimal or unclear climate relevance (for example, Airbnb). Second, startups were excluded due to lack of information if no sector or industry group was specified, the description or tags did not include any relevant keywords and no founding year was provided. Third, startups were excluded from the temporal or geographical scope of this analysis. Startups located outside of the United States were excluded. Startups founded before 2005, the year the first major global climate agreement (the Kyoto Protocol) entered into force, were excluded. When the founding year was not included in the i3 data, it was identified by the authors using previously cleaned data provided by Kurowski and Doblinger and publicly available information from databases such as Pitchbook, Crunchbase and OpenCorporates. Fourth, entities in the dataset were also excluded if they were determined to be a large group or corporation (for example, EON Group), a public agency (for example, the US Department of Energy) or a university or research institute rather than a startup.

Hence, average marginal component effects (AMCEs) were calculated using a simple linear regression estimator with standard errors clustered by respondent, using Stata 14.2 (by StataCorp, see https://www.stata.com/stata14/). The dependent variable is based on the rating scale, and the models include sets of dummy variables for the values of all attribute levels. To ease interpretation of the results, we dichotomized the obtained data with the rating scale using the median (which is 4) as the cut-off value. The resulting dependent variable 'Phase-out Support' is hence coded 0 for cases where a respondent rated a proposal as poor to neutral (1 to 4) and 1 for cases where (s)he rated a proposal as positive (5 to 7). The rationale for using the rating outcome as the dependent variable (instead of the forced-choice outcome) is that it may allow for a more fine-grained assessment of preferences. In the first task (forced choice), respondents had to choose one out of two scenarios in each of eight rounds. However, the comparison of scenarios may include instances where respondents have either strong preferences for or against both proposals\u2014a situation that cannot be meaningfully ascertained by a forced-choice outcome. By contrast, in the rating task respondents could appraise both scenarios independently and on a more fine-grained scale. Nevertheless, replicating the analyses based on the forcedchoice outcome leads to substantively the same results (see Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 84}

First, China's carbon dioxide emission pathway may present varying predictions under the baseline scenario (Supplementary Section 3) and the strictness of achieving the mitigation target directly impacts emission reduction and economic costs. Thus, we set two scenarios for accelerating and delaying the emission reduction progress in the baseline to test this uncertainty. Second, different intensities of mitigation policies may lead to a nonlinear changing trend or turning point for reduced emissions and economic losses. To test this uncertainty, we created 1,295 scenarios by combining different policies with different intensities on the basis of an extensive literature review (Supplementary Section 3.2). We also developed two additional policies with more stringent intensity (grade 6) and weaker intensity (grade 0). Third, the simulation results for achieving the carbon neutrality target may be affected by the substitution elasticity between different energy products in the model. To address this uncertainty, the substitution elasticity between energy products was increased or reduced by 25% to test the robustness of the results. Fourth, energy storage technology can additionally support the growth of high proportions of renewable energy and increase the economic cost. In this paper, we set two scenarios with high-cost and low-cost storage energy development to test the robustness of the simulation results. Finally, enhancing the carbon sequestration capacity is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality goals, as the percentage of scenarios in which the carbon neutrality target is achieved by 2060 will decrease substantially from 11.1% to 0.23%, with a decrease in the carbon sequestration capacity from 2.5 GtCO2 to 1.5 GtCO2 (Supplementary Fig. 22). In this study, we assumed that the capacity is limited to a maximum of 2 GtCO2 from CCS technology and forest systems by 2060. On the basis of the five categories of uncertainty analysis above, we find that the trade-offs and synergies between mitigation policy pairs remain robust: the simultaneous implementation of policies with R and E at high levels has notable positive impacts on all dimensions, and the policy combination with C and R has notable negative impacts on all dimensions.

We use 2024 as the reference year for the current capacity mix because this allows us to acknowledge generation capacity that is very close to coming into market or to closing. Countries' plans foresee the doubling of variable renewables (wind and solar) from slightly above 500 GW to more than 1000 GW by 2030. Solar PV would experience the largest absolute growth, with the addition of more than 300 GW in this decade, whereas wind turbine capacity would increase by more than 230 GW (Supplementary Section 2 provides details). The plans also envision additions to hydropower capacity, battery storage and demand-side response, but on a much smaller scale. As for the retirements, all fossil fuel technologies experience reductions in capacity by 2030 in the NECPs, with coal being the most affected\u2014capacity would be reduced by 41 GW, so that by 2030 coal power plant capacity would be approximately halved. The closure plans of nuclear plants in several countries would also lead to a sharp reduction total deployed capacity in this technology by 2030. Whereas there are important differences in scale across countries, the broad trend towards substitution of fossil fuels and nuclear with variable renewables is common to all countries. The NECPs also reflect a large expansion in the interconnection capabilities of European markets, which is also a driving factor of price formation.

To calculate the speed of aging, we used an epigenetic clock known as the GrimAge index (Horvath and Raj 2018). The index is called GrimAge\u2014after the Grim Reaper\u2014because an accelerated score is grim news. This measure of aging has been shown to be a more robust predictor of morbidity and mortality among different racial groups than other epigenetic clocks currently available (Lu et al. 2019; McCrory et al. 2021). The index was developed by identifying a set of plasma protein predictors of mortality and then using these protein predictors to identify CpG sites that could predict time to death. As expected, the GrimAge index has a weak to moderate correlation with chronological age in the FACHS sample (r = .22), indicating a discrepancy between biological and calendar ages. Following standard procedures, we regressed GrimAge on chronological age to create a speed of aging score or \u201caccelerated aging.\u201d The resulting speed of Grim aging measure was thus adjusted to correlate with chronological age at 0. A positive value on this variable indicates, in years, accelerated epigenetic aging, whereas a negative value indicates, in years, decelerated aging.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 97}

The changes in the corporate tax rates of the different regions were obtained from KPMG (https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home. html). The country sectoral-level emission data were from ref. 29. The cost- minimizing problem faced by firms implies that \u03b2 j l = \u03c1le j il c j il q j il = \u03c1l\u03c5 j l , and therefore \u03b2 j l indicates the share of carbon revenue in output at the country and sector level.

To estimate \u03b2 j l , we first derived the share of the energy and carbon tax revenue in the GDP at the national level, utilizing the data from the OECD database. These data, combined with national emissions, yield the emission tax rate \u03c1l at the national level. Subsequently, multiplying this tax rate by the country-sector-specific emission intensity generates an estimate of \u03b2j l (Supplementary Information 11).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 98}

The framework enables linking river system simulation models (with daily or monthly time steps) with dynamic-recursive annual CGE models. At each annual time step, the coupling framework performs an iterative bidirectional communication between the river system and the CGE simulators to ensure coherence in the annual national-scale irrigation water supply and demand, municipal water supply and demand, hydropower generation, non-hydro generation and capacity, and electricity demand. In each iteration over an annual time step, the river system model quantifies and spatially aggregates national-scale irrigation and municipal water supplies and hydro and non-hydro generation on the basis of the river system's spatial and temporal constraints, infrastructure, and external drivers. This information is then passed to the CGE models as an external shock on the basis of which changes to the economy's municipal and irrigation water demands, electricity demand, and non-hydro capacity are determined and passed back to the river system model for the next iteration. Iterations over each annual time step can be terminated by a maximum number of iterations and/or a convergence error. In this work, we specified a maximum of three iterations between the river system and the economy-wide simulators for each annual time step and a convergence error of US$5 million measured using the Ethiopian real GDP. The coupling framework is implemented using the open-source Python Network Simulation framework81.

We assume that the NDCs are achieved as stipulated and focus on the climate outcomes of their successful implementation. Examining the likelihood of individual regions achieving their submitted targets is beyond the scope of this study. Our representation includes only ratified and quantifiable unconditional NDC commitments, including absolute emissions limit, percentage emission reductions from a given reference level and emission intensity targets. Parties whose commitments included: (1) only actions/policies, (2) non-GHG targets with no corresponding GHG emissions target or (3) only sector-specific GHG emissions reduction targets without attempting to quantify the impact on their overall GHG footprints are assumed to have target year emissions equal to the GCAM emissions in the default reference scenario without any climate policy ('Reference\u2014No Policy' in ref. 5). Likewise, in cases where a country's 2025 and 2030 emissions based on its NDC are lower than the default reference scenario in the same year, the NDC emissions are assumed to be achieved as stipulated. In cases where a country's NDC emissions are higher, emissions are assumed to be equal to the reference scenario. For countries that included multiple types of commitments in their NDCs, such as economy-wide emissions reductions backed by sectoral policies or targets, only the broadest commitment was considered. For example, China's NDC representation in GCAM is based on its commitment to reduce its carbon intensity of GDP by 65% relative to 2005 and it does not explicitly model its targets for non-fossil energy consumption or increased forest stock.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 109}

Most feedback devices display a bundle of elements rather than a single numeric metric52 to put the measurement data into context; frequently used elements include historic comparisons, peer comparisons, analogies and energy savings tips. Likewise, the smart shower meters in rooms assigned to the treatment condition displayed water consumption in litres (one decimal), energy use in (kilo)watt hours, current water temperature, a dynamic rating of the current energy-efficiency class (A-G) and a four-stage animation of a polar bear standing on a melting ice floe with stage transitions at predefined Articles energy use thresholds. The energy consumption displayed on the screen represents the lower bound of the energy used (without losses), and is calculated using the standard engineering formula for heat energy (Q = m xcp x \u2206T, with heat energy Q, mass of water m, heat capacity cp , and \u2206T being the difference between the measured water temperature of the ongoing shower and the average cold-water temperature). In the analysis of energy savings, we take into account the same average heating efficiency and losses as in Tiefenbeck et al.25. The energy-efficiency class displayed was inspired by the (static) energy-efficiency class scale indicated on household appliances in Europe. The smart shower meter dynamically indicates the energy efficiency of the current shower based on the energy use in the ongoing shower, starting in energy efficiency class A and progressing to B, C and so on at predefined kilowatt hour thresholds; the thresholds were defined on the basis of the distribution of energy use per shower in a pilot study. The four stages of the polar bear animation are tied to the energy-efficiency class, and change with the transitions from B to C, D to E and E to F, respectively. While the polar bear may be an eye-catching and memorable display element, it does not seem to drive the savings effects. A related study specifically examined the effect of variations of the design choices of the feedback elements; the results indicate that if the polar bear animation makes any difference, it reduces rather than increases the effectiveness of the display52.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 110}

The results of these analyses are provided in Supplementary Tables 13-16.These robustness and sensitivity analyses attempted to account for as many factors as possible. However, other potentially relevant variables were not included in this analysis due to lack of data availability, which is a common problem due to a widespread focus on secrecy in competitive startup sectors, or difficulty accessing granular data for the large numbers of entities included in this analysis.

The following four parameters were used: the mean minimum dietary energy requirement, the coefficient of Nature Climate ChaNge variation of the distribution of food within a country, the mean food availability in the country (kcal per capita per day) and total population. Minimum dietary energy requirements are exogenously calculated on the basis of demographic composition (age, sex) of future population projections. Future changes in the inequality of food distribution within a country are exogenous and follow projected national income growth. This is based on an estimated relationship between income and the coefficient of variation of food distribution with observed historical national-level data. Poor infrastructure, remoteness and a high prevalence of subsistence farming limit local markets in distributing food equally across households7. Income is lowest in SAS and SSA, regions in which the share of land under subsistence farming is the largest (27% in SAS and 43% in SSA)54. Food availability in kcal per capita per day is endogenously determined by GLOBIOM at the regional level. One limitation of the approach is that it does not include within-country distributional consequences of trade integration and/ or climate change through income effects. Trade policies and climate change alter food prices, which affects individual incomes, purchasing power and food access depending on households being net consumers or net producers of food33. At the aggregate regional level, the bias from not considering these distributional effects may be upward or downward, depending on the share of net-consuming versus net-producing households; degree of subsistence farming versus agricultural wage work; and share of rural versus urban population in each country.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 118}

Processing, downscaling and bias correction of the GCM simulations were driven by the requirement for transient (2017-2100) three-hourly forcing data across seven climate variables that govern the surface mass and energy balances in the hydrological model (described in the next section). The seven variables are precipitation, temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, humidity, wind speed and surface pressure. Given the large spatial domain, the low availability of subdaily model output for all of the relevant variables in CMIP6 and challenges of multivariate bias correction51, we derived bias-corrected transient projections by (1) resampling the 0.25\u00b0 historical baseline climate dataset to match the (detrended) relative variability of the selected GCM projections and then (2) applying perturbation factors to reintroduce the change signal extracted from the GCMs following a quantile delta mapping approach52.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 119}

The variable costs of each technology include a non-fuel variable operating cost plus a fuel cost, which is defined in turn by the fuel price per thermal MWh and the thermal efficiency of each plant type. GenX allows for the simulation of storage technologies, including hydropower plants with reservoirs and/or pumping capabilities and batteries. Because the algorithm minimizes the total annual cost, the resulting solution assumes perfect foresight of hourly profiles for capacity factors, inflows and demands for the full year. Hence, batteries and reservoirs will be charged and discharged in the optimal dispatch solution provided by GenX at the times that minimize the total cost of electricity generation for the full year. GenX includes the possibility to curtail demand if the cost of satisfying it exceeds a pre-set value of loss load parameter (set at 3,000 euros in our analysis). GenX also allows for demand-side response capabilities, which allow to anticipate or delay certain loads at a cost. The full solution of GenX dispatch is characterized by hourly generation profiles for each technology in each country/area and the hourly electricity flows across countries/areas (given the restrictions imposed by network capabilities). The Lagrange multiplier associated with the increase of 1 MWh in demand for a given country at a given hour is also calculated. Any technology in the model can set the marginal price, including variable renewables, storage, interconnectors or demand-side response.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 120}

Several of these BRFSS variables have different versions that factor age of respondent and frequency of use of the service. For these measures, we analyzed the versions that included the largest sample sizes to provide the most complete picture of gendered patterns of health care use. For example, there were two versions of the question about mammograms: (1) women who have ever had a mammogram and (2) women age 40+ who have had a mammogram in the past 2 years. We used the former measure because the 2018 mammogram recommendations vary for women 40 years and older, and therefore, the latter measure may miss important variation by limiting the time period. Most health care services apply to both men and women; however, there were three that were asked only of women and one that was asked only of men (described in the following). All respondents were asked about a variety of health care services. These included dichotomous measures of whether respondents had a person they thought of as their personal doctor, if they had ever had a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy or been tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and whether within the past year they had visited a doctor for a routine checkup, gotten a flu shot, or visited a dentist, dental hygienist, or dental clinic. For women, they were also asked if they had ever had a mammogram, pap test, or human papillomavirus (HPV) test. For men, they asked if they had ever had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.

Given the semistructured nature of the interviews, findings for this article around providers' efforts to minimize and manage bias emerged unprompted during the interviews when providers were asked about their approaches to patients. We then ensured that all examples fit the codes and subcodes. To maintain consistency, researchers reviewed transcripts in pairs for intercoder reliability and continuously memoed throughout the coding process about relevant themes.

New conventional oil fields take several years to bring into production and additional supply in the short term (within 1 year) can only come from either inventory, politically withheld supply (including, for example, Saudi Arabian spare capacity), shale oil production and infill drilling in conventional fields.Compared with demand elasticity studies, supply elasticity studies are rare. Caldara et al.22 compile six studies applying different methods and data and find short-term (within 1 year) supply elasticities in the range of 0-0.27. These estimates are based on historical data and do not necessarily reflect current or future oil supply. As a complement, we also rely on modelled forward-looking estimates of supply elasticity derived by Wachtmeister25 using a bottom-up modelling framework and Rystad UCube field-by-field data, as well as our own judgement of the current oil market outlook.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 129}

This is a complex urban area with a substantial proportion of impervious surfaces. The land-use cover obtained from the National Land Cover Database 2019 (NLCD, https://www.mrlc.gov) indicates a predominant presence of developed areas with buildings, driveways, pavements and parking, with an impervious surface ratio reaching 94.48% (Supplementary  Fig. 18). The terrain in this region is relatively flat, with a northward slope adjacent Bear Creek. According to FEMA reports, some Warren  areas fall within the 100- and 500-year flood zones. To ensure a  realistic simulation, a substantial amount of digital and field observational data were collected to set up the model accurately. The overall simulation domain encompasses the entire Red Run watershed in which the Warren region is nested (Fig. 2a). This was done to ensure the modeling of spatial flood processes, such as surface inflows into the Warren area from other sub-basins and the simulation of flood waves in the Red Run River and its tributaries and their impact on the Warren area. High-resolution elevation data (0.6-m resolution)  were used to set up the overland flow model (Lidar Point Cloud data kindly provided by the USGS, https://apps.nationalmap.gov/ downloader/) (Supplementary Fig. 19a). Land-use and land-cover data with a 30-m resolution obtained from the NLCD were used to estimate roughness parameters for the model. Similarly, impervious surface data with a 30-m resolution, also derived from the NLCD, were used to estimate infiltration parameters. It is worth noting that other areas within the Red Run watershed also exhibited high impervious surface ratios, ranging mostly between 47% and 95%.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 130}

According to a 1988 Report to Congress51 and conversations with programme officers at the FWS, not all eligible areas were designated as part of the original system for two primary reasons. First, USGS quadrangles used in the inventory process did not show sufficient detail to identify all qualifying undeveloped coastal barrier areas.

To ensure a representative sample, countries are divided into two groups: those with more than 75,000 forested grid cells and those with fewer than 75,000 forested grid cells. For the first group, we randomly selected 10% of all grid cells. For the second group, we first determined the minimum random sample percentage according to Lohr18 and then proportionally sample this percentage of grid cells across states within countries. T he sample was limited to grid cells that had a minimum of 50% forest cover in 2010 and at least 25 ha of forest with canopy cover \u226560%. Brazilian forests in the Amazon biome are excluded from the analyses due to the existing monitoring system there. We study all countries that had access to the alerts before 2018 (Fig. 1a).

We distinguish between the demand for crude oil for vehicle fuel in the EU, DEU, and the remaining oil demand DROW. Note that the rest of the world demand includes oil demand in the EU for uses other than vehicle fuel. Since we want to study the effects of taxes on vehicle fuel in the EU, we explicitly consider these and assume that the demand for oil for fuel in the EU depends on the price, including refinement, transportation and taxes. Let p denote the crude oil price, v the VAT rate and \u03c4 the per-unit tax on vehicle fuel in the EU. The costs for refinement and transportation could have one per-unit component, c, and one component proportional to the price, z. We thus have the fuel pricef=(1+v)((1+z)p+c+\u03c4) (10)and crude demand in the EU depends on this price and on income I, DEU(f, I). The rest of the world demand depends directly on the crude oil price DROW(p). In the baseline model, we focus on per-unit costs, corresponding to z = 0.

In the first periods, the trajectory of the tax is smoothed out from the exponential path to avoid abrupt changes in the pricing profile. To mimic the existence of hard-to-abate sectors and emissions, the maximum rate of abatement via conventional mitigation MIUmax is capped at 0.975 for all countries, corresponding to 97.5% of baseline emissions and around 2 GtCO2 in 2100 globally. Non-CO2 gases are not priced and do not contribute to the global budget. To decrease the computational complexity of the problem and to avoid implicit transfers across regions via mitigation effort shifting, each region solves as an independent optimization and convergence is achieved by solving iteratively all regions. Nonetheless, the superimposed shape of the global carbon tax produces a de facto cooperative scenario even though each regional optimization problem is solved independently, in the sense that implicit cooperation is assumed in negotiating (and abiding to) the carbon tax level and growth across countries.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 140}

Categorizing policy measures in the ASI framework can be ambiguous in some cases. For example, stimulating adoption of heat pumps both improves the building technical systems and induces a shift from higher-carbon fuels to electrification for space heating.

A document was considered fully consistent if it provided evidence of intentional linkages across all four components of the adaptation cycle. For instance, actions to switch to drought-resistant crops or strengthen early warning systems for hydroclimatic risks in coastal areas indicate linkages between assessment and planning (Supplementary Table 3).

In the first stage, risk-averse investment and financial trading decisions are made by a number of agents. Spot market prices are determined through a perfectly competitive dispatch over time blocks, t2T I ,  performed by the system operator in the second stage. The ultimate source of all generator revenue in the model is energy sales; financial contracts settle based on the prices realized in the second stage. Instead of writing the optimality conditions for each of the subproblems and reformulating as a complementarity problem9,41,42, we anticipate the algorithm that we describe later in this section and focus on the problems solved by each agent. Our modelling framework builds most directly on the approaches of de Maere d'Aertrycke and co-workers41,]42, which describe a risk-averse capacity equilibrium with incomplete markets. We make two modifications of note, which we describe in detail after introducing the model. Incomplete trading has significant ramifications, both computationally and conceptually. The computational issue is that, instead of a comparatively simple optimization problem, the problem is formulated using a construct called a multiple optimization problem with equilibrium constraints43. Although modest-sized instances can be solved by the PATH solver44, numerical tests on larger instances can fail to converge. To help address this issue, we proposed a heuristic decomposition algorithm similar in spirit to that of H\u00f6schle et al.45, which allows the identification of equilibria through a series of convex quadratic programs. Although the test systems used in this article are kept simple, this decomposition approach allows an easier extension to a richer set of technologies and risks. The conceptual concern is that the uniqueness of the equilibrium solutions cannot, in general, be guaranteed. We revisit this topic after introducing the algorithm.

A setback policy prohibits oil (and gas) extraction within a specified distance from sensitive sites including occupied dwellings, schools, healthcare facilities and playgrounds. We model two setback scenarios: (1) setbacks that apply to new wells only (main results) and (2) setbacks that apply to new and existing wells or all wells. We model setbacks on new wells by proportionally reducing field-level future new well entry based on the relative field area covered by a given setback buffer. For existing wells, setbacks are implemented in our model by removing those within the setback distance from future production. We consider setback distances of 1,000 feet, 2,500 feet and 1 mile. We assume only vertical drilling in the setback analysis. Horizontal and directional drilling from pads outside of the setback distance could access additional sub-surface oil resources within the setback distance, reducing our estimates of the health and equity benefits of setbacks, especially for shorter setback distances44. However, the costs and extent of adoption of horizontal drilling are uncertain for California and thus are not included in this study. The excise-tax policy imposes a tax on each barrel of crude oil extracted. In our projection period, we apply a constant tax rate to the oil price each year. This is consistent with historical proposals for excise taxes on California oil extraction45. The carbon-tax policy imposes a tax on the GHG emissions from the oil-extraction site. We consider only direct GHG emissions, excluding methane emissions due to a lack of reliable oil-field-specific data. All carbon-tax trajectories increase at an annual rate of 7%, the sum of a 5% real growth rate and 2% inflation rate per year (ref. 46). We determine the excise-tax rates applied to the oil price and carbon taxes that result in the following 2045 statewide GHG emissions targets using an optimization function: (1) 2045 statewide GHG emissions associated with the three setback distances (Supplementary Table 4) and (2) a 90% reduction in statewide GHG emissions compared with 2019. The excise and carbon taxes are shown in Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16 and are inputs to the oil-extraction model and affect future well entry and exit.

Under the no recycling scenario, final consumption of each quintile is computed by subtracting climate damages and mitigation costs from gross consumption according to distributions that reflect different exposures and vulnerabilities of consumption groups to these impacts. Under the recycling scenario, carbon taxes are raised according to the same distribution as mitigation costs and redistributed as equal per capita payments within regions. The baseline distribution is given by quintile weights, qijt , that denote the ratio between quintile consumption and average consumption. If for quintile j in region i and period t, qijt > 1, its consumption is greater than average regional consumption in that period; if qijt < 1, its consumption is less than the average. Since the five quintiles comprise equal proportions of the population, \u2211 j qijt=5 in all regions and periods. In the base implementation these quintile weights are fixed across time and estimated to the current distribution of consumption in the region by aggregating country level distributional data from the World Income Inequality Database58 to regional distributions.

Choice experiments were developed in marketing research to investigate the importance of different product design features in determining purchasing preferences. The idea is to put respondents in a hypothetical yet realistic choice situation in which they are confronted with bundles of relevant product attributes. By observing stated preferences with regard to the presented alternatives, it is possible to examine the relevance of certain product attributes and their characteristics to individual choices. Political scientists have adopted the method to gauge citizens' preferences with regard to different policy proposals or scenarios26,49. Analytically, the design features of a policy are similar to product attributes, which is why the method provides a powerful approach to simultaneously estimate the individual effects of several attributes of a policy proposal on voter preferences50. Choice experiments require decision-makers to make trade-offs between different policy attributes when evaluating various multidimensional alternatives. As a consequence, they can mitigate the problem of social desirability bias in public opinion research on environmental matters26.

We evaluate cointegration by estimating each possible specification using OLS and testing the residual for a unit root with four statistics (PT, DFGLS, QT and DFGLSu)56. Statistics that reject the null hypothesis indicate that the residual does not contain a unit root, which indicates that the variables cointegrate and therefore represent a long-run cointegrating relation for price. The long-run relation between Price and the proxies for the balance between supply and demand are estimated using DOLS57.

The CBRS designation process is described in detail in the 1982 Federal Register and in refs. 42,43, where the US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) establishes a set of 'definitions and delineation criteria'. CBRS designations were then based upon the application of these criteria to on-the-ground situations. The first criteria for CBRS designations is that the land should be a 'coastal barrier', a class of low coastal land forms that protect landward areas from tidal, wave or wind energies. For the purposes of CBRS designations, the definition of coastal barriers also includes all associated aquatic habitats such as adjacent wetlands, marshes, estuaries, inlets and nearshore waters. In addition to meeting this geological definition, the CBRS requires coastal barriers to be 'undeveloped' in order to be included in the system. Specifically, the delineation criteria state that an area should be considered \u201conly if there are few manmade structures on the barrier or any portion thereof and these structures and man's activities on the barrier do not significantly impede geomorphic and ecological processes\u201d42.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 157}

Analysis of themes reported here was inductive: We had no a priori expectation about what children's health lifestyles consisted of, how health or health behaviors were defined, or how they would vary. We analyzed observational field notes together with parent interviews to compare personal accounts to observed behaviors, allowing themes to arise organically and coding for some predetermined themes. People's public and private accounts and behaviors are often inconsistent in sociologically meaningful ways (Swidler 2001). Because the communities' health lifestyles were similar even though distribution and degree varied, we combined the communities here. We viewed the interviews and focus groups as opportunities for participants to actively construct narratives (Holstein and Gubrium 1995). Through narratives situated in specific social contexts, people construct identities, justify actions, and manage others' impressions (Swidler 2001). Narratives, which shed light on norms, individual and group identities, and inequalities, turned out to be an important aspect of children's health lifestyles. Our goal was not to adjudicate whether parenting, specific health lifestyles, or their consequences are good or bad.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 158}

Life expectancy is an ideal indicator of overall population health because it reflects age-specific mortality rates spanning all ages for a particular year. Our key indicator of income inequality was the income share of the top 10% of earners based off pretax gross income reported to the Internal Revenue Service. These data were obtained from the U.S. State-Level Income Inequality Database, developed by Mark Frank (2015) and constructed from individual tax filing data available from the Internal Revenue Service. From the same source, we also obtained alternative measure of income inequality to use in supplemental analyses. These measures included the share of the top .1%, 1%, and 5% of income earners and the Gini index. The main source of data on state policies came from Grumbach (2018). These measures, shown in Table 1, contained 135 policies spanning 16 domains: abortion, campaign finance, civil rights and liberties, criminal justice, education, environment, gun control, health and welfare, housing and transportation, immigration, private sector labor, public sector labor, LGBT rights, marijuana, taxes, and voting. Evidence on how these policy domains are plausibly linked to life expectancy are described elsewhere (Kemp, Grumbach, and Montez 2022). For each state, the data contained a score for each domain annually from 2000 through 2014.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 159}

We use this source to extract two datasets at different resolutions. For the first, we use a national database of LPG purchase by PMUY beneficiaries aggregated at the state level. These data were made available by a senior official from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India. It contains data on 30 million PMUY beneficiaries, aggregated by state, who have completed at least 1 year as LPG consumers (based on their date of enrolment). For regression analysis to explain the state-wise variation in LPG consumption, refer to Supplementary Note 9 and Supplementary Fig. 12. For further details of the regression analyses and validity checks of the underlying assumptions for linear models, see Supplementary Code 1 hosted on Figshare45. The second dataset comprises sub-district level data gathered from three Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) LPG distributors in Koppal district of Karnataka state. These were conveniently located near another ongoing project site. The three distributors D1, D2 and D3 serve 25,000 domestic consumers from around 120 villages across four taluks.

Among those that subsidize, some target their subsidies towards low-income, vulnerable populations and use them for relatively brief periods; others subsidize most or all of their citizens over many years. Our study is concerned with the latter group of countries, which are typically the focus of international efforts to reduce fossil fuel subsidies. We follow convention and define a subsidy as the difference between the price paid by consumers and the cost of bringing the fuel to market14. To measure the size of these subsidies, we use the price gap method, which compares the observed retail price of a fuel in each country with a global benchmark price, which represents the supply cost. Anytime the retail price falls below the benchmark price (for example, the cost of supplying the fuel), it denotes a subsidy for that period. To identify the countries that were net subsidizers in the pre Paris era, we use the ref. 15 dataset of monthly gasoline taxes and subsidies, which covers 157 countries. We include in the sample all countries whose median gasoline price for the 2003-2015 period was below the median benchmark for the same period, meaning they were net subsidizers during this initial period. This yields 22 countries, one of which (Yemen) we drop due to missing data in the period after its civil war began.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 169}

We make the simplifying assumption that one barrel of oil yields 170 l of products and fuels that can be sold to consumers. In the base case, the variable production cost of these fuels is assumed to correspond directly to the crude oil price (that is, the variable fuel production cost is the global oil price per barrel (Brent; in US$ per barrel) measured in Euros per litre of fuel product (p)). The retail fuel price (consumer price) is then the variable fuel production cost (oil price, p) plus the other, fixed, production costs, c (refining, transport, margins and so on), plus the fuel tax, \u03c4, then VAT is applied to all of these. In the sensitivity analysis (see Supplementary Note 3), we explore other variable production costs (z) and discuss which case is more likely. Our base case c of \u20ac0.45 l-1 is derived backwards from a consumer price of \u20ac1.9 l-1. c thus includes the current refinery margins (the value difference between crude oil and refined products), which vary in time and are currently at historically high levels.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 171}

From this lens, we considered all the turbines that need to be dismantled to enable the undertaking of the new project (as a conditional requirement). We used the term dismantling, but, in principle, our approach can capture both the complete dismantling of turbines (also referred to as full repowering4), and the installation of new equipment (for example, drivetrain and rotor) on an existing tower and/or foundation (also referred to as partial repowering4). We emphasize that the analysis must include the dismantling of existing turbines not only at the location of the new project undertaking (on-site), but also those located elsewhere (off-site). Furthermore, existing turbines may be dismantled years before the new turbines are installed. Therefore, repowering must reflect a combined action of dismantling existing turbines and establishing new turbines, regardless of spatial or temporal proximity. We thus investigated the conditional relationship between capacity reduction and capacity addition. This enabled us to reveal notable differences between repowering projects (comprising both commissioning new turbines and dismantling existing turbines) and greenfield projects (only comprising the commissioning of new turbines) for several key indicators, such as project size and lifetime.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 173}

Baseline models pooling across social class are shown in Appendix Table A.1. The CEM package in Stata 14 was used to independently and ex ante ensure that diagnosed and undiagnosed children were \u201cexact matches\u201d on three characteristics on which there are well- established differences in diagnosis and future behaviors: (1) family social class (3 groups); (2) quartile of pre-diagnosis behavioral problems based on parent- and teacher-rated subscales for inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive behavioral type (16 groups); and (3) child sex (2 groups). The continuous variables for social class and pre-diagnosis ADHD-related behaviors were first temporarily \u201ccoarsened\u201d into the above categories so that matching occurred within the 96 broad groups above (3 x 16 x 2 = 96). All 380 diagnosed children were successfully matched to otherwise comparable undiagnosed children. By contrast, 340 (.5% of) undiagnosed children were pruned for reasons of achieving balance described in the Online Appendix.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 177}

So as not to affect any of the aggregate economic variables (investment, capital, output and so on), this is done by splitting average regional consumption into five units (or quintiles) after aggregate savings have been determined. The background consumption distribution and the distributions of damage and mitigation cost are determined in the way described below. We denote regions by index i, quintiles by j and periods by t. Quantities without a j index are regional aggregates and are identical to the quantities in the more aggregated RICE model. Net output Yit is given by Yit=1-\u03bbit 1+Dit Qit (1) where Qit denotes gross output, \u03bbit mitigation cost (opportunity costs of reducing CO2 emissions as a share of GDP) and Dit climate damages. The basic trade-off of the RICE model\u2014mitigation costs in the present for the reduction of climate damages in the future\u2014is embodied in this equation. As mentioned above, in each period the regional mitigation costs are chosen so that they are consistent with a globally uniform carbon price, which is implemented as a local tax, taxt , in each region.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 178}

The 20-80% decarbonization results are presented in the main text, and 95% decarbonization results are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7 as a sensitivity run to understand the required energy system changes in line with a 1.5\u00b0C global climate stabilization target and close to the Biden Administration's net-zero emissions target. We assume linear GHG mitigation pathways from 2015 to 2050 with 5-year interval (see trajectories for GHG targets in Supplementary Fig. 1). Since GCAM-USA is embedded within the global GCAM model and allows for interactions between the United States and the rest of the world through global markets, to avoid cross-country carbon leakage, we set decarbonization targets for other countries based on ref. 53, which are consistent with the 2\u00b0C pathway. We consider three subnational policy approaches to achieve the national targets. Under the Uniform approach, the model solves a single MAC (and in turn carbon price) nationally to meet the decarbonization target. The MAC is uniform NATUrE CliMATE ChANGE across states, which is determined by the marginal cost to mitigate the last unit of CO2 emissions nationally. Under the Hybrid and Heterogeneous approaches, we allow for heterogeneous MACs across states. We set the relative ratio of state-level MACs based on the present-day public support level for climate policy, then let the model solve the whole set of MACs for 51 states (Figs. 1b and 2 and Supplementary Methods). Note that the MACs capture the effects similar to a carbon price. A high MAC encourages the deployment of high-cost CO2 mitigation technologies (such as renewable electricity and BECCS) as well as a reduction in overall fossil energy use. As long as the importing activities can reduce energy production and associated emissions within the state boundary, our approach would not further require importing only low-carbon electricity or goods.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 182}

We characterize it as an investable technology in the model, such that each region can choose to reduce emissions with either standard abatement or via carbon removal. Since we explicitly model NETs, MIU is capped below 100%, meaning the investable technology is the only means to reach net-negative emissions. We choose to model our representative NET technology as DAC. DAC is modelled as in Realmonte et al.30 as an investable technology with depreciating capital, and emissions captured must be stored geologically. Total costs are divided into investment and variable costs (which implicitly include fuel and operation and maintenance costs), as well as storage costs. Total costs shrink with time due to learning by doing. The storage cost depends on the storage type (aquifer, exhausted oil and gas field, for instance) and each storage type has a regional cumulative capacity limit. No leakage is considered from the geological sites.

At the end of the survey, they were given a personalized link to a web-based online climate betting site. Upon logging in to the site, they were presented with a number of climate betting markets and could take a position on any number of them (Fig. 1). In addition, participants could choose to trade a position with other participants. The number of available markets changed daily based on old markets closing and new markets opening. Participants could place multiple bets on the same market and could trade continuously before the bet's settle date and time. During the betting period, participants could log in to the prediction market site whenever they wished, monitor their currently available funds, view the available markets, make bets or trade positions. The market mechanism was 'double auction' (Supplementary Information), which required two participants to take opposite bets such that the sum of two bets was US$1 (that is, if one participant chose to wager US$0.60 that a 'Yes' bet will occur, only when another participant wagered US$0.40 that a 'No' on the outcome would a contract be initiated). If no participant was willing to take the opposite wager, the offer remained pending until the participant making the offer chose to revoke it. The manifested value of each market at any given moment was that of the last 'Yes' transaction to occur. That is, if a participant made a bet for US$0.82 that the average methane level in October 2018 will be the highest on record and another participant took the opposite position at US$0.12, then all participants saw the current market value as US$0.82. Accordingly, the values of markets represented the aggregated stable amount of money people were agreeing to wager on each topic. Naturally, as the settlement date of markets approached, the bets were likely to converge to the probability (0\u2026100) of the correct outcome (that is, if the market asked whether the number of disasters in a certain location be more than 10 by a certain date, and a few days before the closing time, a number of disasters already reached 9, the likelihood of a 'Yes' bet was higher). The betting period was initiated on 9 September 9 2018, and lasted until 11 November 11 2018. When the betting period was complete, participants were instructed to complete a post-survey. Once participants completed the post-survey, they were paid for their participation in the entire study. The pre- and post-surveys included a variety of questions (Supplementary Information provide all questions), but the main focus of the study was the subset of questions pertaining to the concern about climate change.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 184}

The SBTi developed these pathways from a subset of the pathways described in the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change42. SBTi determined this subset by applying criteria related to temperature limit probability, temporary overshoot of emission budget, year of peak emissions and near-term emission reduction rate, with the aim of isolating pathways conforming with principles of plausibility, responsibility, objectivity, and consistency41. The SBTi notes that linearization of emission pathways over long timespans can result in substantial deviations of the pathways' cumulative emissions and therefore recommends the use of the derived reduction rates (4.2% and 2.5%) for the shorter time span of 2020-2035. However, the SBTi also advises companies to apply these reductions rates to set SBTs for base years before 20206, and SBTi applied the requirement of the 1.5 \u00b0C pathway (4.2% reduction in base year emissions per year) as a benchmark for the combined emission trajectory of companies with SBTs in the 2015-2019 period in its latest target progress report8.

We first estimate historical GHG emissions factors using the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimator (OPGEE) model v2.0 from the California Air Resources Board51,52 (Supplementary Fig. 10 provides 2015 data). The OPGEE model is an engineering-based life-cycle assessment tool for the measurement of GHG emissions from the production, processing and transport of crude oil. Using the OPGEE model and oil-extraction data from the California Department of Conservation, we model field-level GHG emissions for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. We consider only upstream emissions from exploration, drilling, crude production, surface processing, maintenance operations, waste treatment/disposal and other small sources (as modelled by OPGEE). To obtain emissions factors for oil fields that were not modelled by OPGEE, we apply the median emissions factors for the fields that were modelled, separated by the use of steam injection (Supplementary Note 12  provides more information). To estimate the field-level GHG emissions for the projection period (2020-2045), we average the historical emissions factors for each year, again separated by fields based on the use of steam injection. We then linearly regress the average emissions factors and extrapolate over the projection period. Last, we apply the percent change in emissions factor between each forecast year to the field-level historical emissions factors from 2018 onwards to determine field-level emissions factors for each forecast year.

We used home addresses to match adopter records at the address level to household-level variables for income, housing type and housing tenure purchased from Experian. Household-level incomes are estimated from individual- and household-level variables and a proprietary model developed by Experian, an empirically driven algorithm built to effectively predict sample statistics (for example, means, medians) of solar adopter incomes. The income estimates have been empirically validated in previous research on solar adopters13. The housing type variable is based on US Postal Service data. The housing tenure variable is based primarily on tax assessment and deed data. We predicted household-level racial characteristics using the 'wru' package in R36. The wru package estimates continuous probabilities for household race/ethnicity in five categories (Asian or Asian American, Black, Hispanic, White, other) based on the surname of the household's Census tract and the surname of the head of household. In cases where the surname was unavailable (12% of records), wru predicts race based only on the Census tract. Removing these tract-only predictions from the data does not substantially affect the results (Supplementary Fig. 2). The wru algorithm has been empirically validated to predict household race with around or above 80% accuracy5,37. We converted the continuous probabilities to a binary people of colour or Hispanic variable score based on whether some race other than White was assigned the greatest probability. We compare solar adopter demographics to the general population using state-level demographic statistics from the US Census American Community Survey. However, we omit the statewide comparison for race because the continuous race probabilities estimated by wru cannot be meaningfully compared to the self-identified races reported in Census data.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 193}

The CEEGE model is based on the neoclassical economics theory and assumes that the market is fully competitive and that the returns to scale of production are constant. It contains six economic agents (production, investment, consumption, government, foreign and inventory) and three primary factors (labour, capital and land) and is solved with the GEMPACK software51. In this model, a system of linearized equations is established to describe the behaviours of agents in response to price changes and determines the equilibrium price and quantity by equating the demand and supply for all goods and factors. The model can be used to capture the direct and indirect effects of exogenous changes in the economy and assess the impact mechanism across the economy. Hence, it provides a valuable tool for various policy-oriented studies related to carbon mitigation52,53. The modules of production, household consumption, governmental consumption, investment, export demand, carbon accounting and pricing, the dynamic module, the equilibrium mechanism, macro-economic closure and energy storage are presented in Supplementary Section 4.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 196}

Our model nested annual state-level observations within states. In total, 611 observations (Level 1) were nested within the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Level 2) from 2006 to 2017. The two-level random intercept model, also known as the within-between random-effects model (REWB) or the hybrid model,2 allowed us to model the within and between effects for each driver of drug-related mortality. The model is written as follows: - - ij \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 y x x x u e = + - + + + ij 0 1 2 ( ) . j j j ij b1 represents the within effects, which are estimated by group mean centering the variables, and b2 is the group mean, which represents the between effects. uj is the Level 2 error term, and eij is the Level 1 error term.3 The primary advantage of this model is that it allows the researcher to obtain both the within and between effects simultaneously. Doing so is not possible in the standard fixed-effects model, which relies on within variance only, or the standard  random-effects model, which uses a weighted average of within and between variance (Bell, Fairbrother, and Jones 2019). In the context of this study, it allowed us to test whether an increase in a driver within a state had the same effect as cross-sectional differences (the average level of the driver) between states.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 197}

BRFSS is the largest continuously conducted health survey in the world and collects annual, cross-sectional data from respondents in all 50 states about health behaviors and conditions and demographics. Some questions vary each year, thus we used 2018 data because it was the most recent year that had the most applicable and complete data on preventive health care use. It was also important to avoid 2020 data due to the impact of COVID-19 on health care use. Our analytic sample consisted of 425,454 individuals, of which 192,854 were men and 232,600 were women. The sample sizes varied for each preventive health care service outcome, depending on how many individuals responded to each of the questions.\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 198}

The PSID began with  a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 families and 18,000 individuals. Information from these individuals and their descendants was collected annually from 1968 to 1995 and biennially thereafter. The PSID was ideal for our purposes. The long-running administration of the PSID allows for the prospective tracking of individual employment characteristics, avoiding inaccuracies produced by retrospective accounting of one's career. Moreover, the PSID began collecting extensive health information of individuals in the 1990s. Main data came from the WZB-PSID file, which incorporates information from the Cross-National Equivalent File (Brady and Kohler 2022).\n\n    Summary:", "answer": "None (Use GPT-o3 as the judge).", "id": 199}
